# News Data Analysis, Classification, and Web Scraping

This repository contains Python code for performing news data analysis, text classification, and web scraping from "The Wire" news website.

## Overview

The repository is structured to showcase two main functionalities:

### 1. Web Scraping from The Wire

The Jupyter Notebook `News_Scraping.ipynb` exhibits:
- Extracting news articles from various sections of "The Wire" news website
- Gathering links, sections, headings, and news content
- Storing the scraped data in a CSV file (`News_Data_Set.csv`)
  
### 2. News Data Analysis and Classification

The Jupyter Notebook `News_Data_Analysis.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing news data from a CSV file (`News_Data_Set.csv`)
- Training a Random Forest Classifier for text classification
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Evaluating the model's performance
