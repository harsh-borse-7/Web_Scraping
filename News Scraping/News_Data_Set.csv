https://thewire.in/video/rajasthan-polls-minister-shanti-dhariwal-interview,Video,"Rajasthan Polls: Minister Shanti Dhariwal Talks About Controversial Riverfront Project, Next CM","Rajasthan cabinet minister Shanti Dhariwal has dropped hints regarding the potential successor to the chief minister’s post in Rajasthan. Dhariwal, a three-time MLA from Kota (North) and a former Lok Sabha MP from Kota in 1984, is widely recognised as an Ashok Gehlot loyalist. Currently contesting from the Kota (North) seat, he played a crucial role alongside Mahesh Joshi in September 2022 in organising a separate meeting at his residence when the senior leadership was discussing the possibility of a change in power in Rajasthan. Addressing the question of whether the Congress has a chief ministerial face in Rajasthan, Dhariwal said, “We do. Can’t you see how the chief minister has worked in the past five years? Don’t you see his schemes?” This statement comes as a strong endorsement of the incumbent chief minister Ashok Gehlot, under whose government Dhariwal serves as the urban development and housing minister. However, later, Dhariwal added that the party’s senior leadership will decide who the next chief minister will be and that he will abide by the senior leadership’s decision.  Dhariwal’s constituency, Kota (North), known as a second home for thousands of students preparing for NEET-JEE exams, has unfortunately witnessed a surge in suicides this year. On this matter, Dhariwal chose not to delve into specifics and simply called it an “old matter” that he did not wish to address. One of Dhariwal’s flagship projects – the Rs 14,000 crore Chambal riverfront development – ran into controversy this year. The opposition has alleged that the riverfront construction has adversely affected wildlife. Former MLA Prahlad Gunjal from Kota (North) contended that the area, where the riverfront is located, is a crocodile sanctuary with a designated eco-sensitive zone extending up to 10 kilometres. The matter is set to be investigated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and Dhariwal asserted his openness to scrutiny, emphasising that all necessary steps were taken before initiating the project. In response to questions about the delay in finalising his ticket and rumours of corruption, Dhariwal clarified that during the Bharat Jodo Yatra, many people complained against him to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. This prompted an investigation by a team set up by the chief minister and Dhariwal was subsequently cleared of any corruption allegations and granted the party ticket. Dhariwal’s name has become a catchphrase in the state’s political discourse in the run-up to the assembly elections because of a controversial statement he made in the Vidhan Sabha where he said, “Rajasthan mardon ka pradesh hai (It’s a man’s land).” In his defence, he said, “Yes, I did say that, but why is the opposition only questioning that part? Why are they not showing the complete video where I also criticised this serious issue?” As Rajasthan gears up for elections on November 25, these developments set the stage for a dynamic political landscape in the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://thewire.in/caste/tracing-the-long-complex-history-of-debate-on-caste-census,Caste,"Tracing the Long, Complex History of Debate on Caste Census","The Bihar caste census has caused quite a clamour. Counterintuitively, the survey has revealed that Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) together make up over 63% of the state’s population. Indeed, since its revelation, livid ultimatums by the opposition have demanded the extension of the exercise in other states. This curious insistence might make it seem that the opposition, which has bandwagoned for the census in the name of ‘social justice’, has always been in favour of enumerating caste. However, a longer history of the politics around the caste census reveals mixed attitudes on the statistical enumeration of caste by prominent political parties, even those that vociferously demand it today. The debate on the first post-Independence census included discussions on whether to include caste as a parameter. Ambedkar was crisp on why an up-to-date database was instrumental in formulating policy measures and ensuring representation of the diverse communities in India. The Congress party championed the idea of collecting caste-based data for purposes of affirmative action in the first post-Independence census of 1951. However, this would imply that caste enumeration would be limited to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Following this logic, the state under Nehruvian leadership made a policy decision not to conduct a caste-wise population enumeration, except for the scheduled categories. Also read: Need of the Hour: A Selfie Called Caste Census – India Must Confront its Truth Collation of caste-based data, other than for purposes of affirmative action, was seen as ironically ‘entrenching the caste system’. Unironically, following Independence, the 1951 census data on caste was never made public. Concerns of privacy, potential misuse, social unrest, and even state capacity to assemble such data with accuracy were cited as reasons. In the thick of many of these concerns and the administrative challenges of processing such voluminous and potentially controversial data, subsequent debates on caste enumeration were delayed, if not completely evaded. Again, the grand narrative of ‘national integration’ was instrumentalised – Indians had to ‘move beyond caste’ once and for all. In the nearly 30 years of uninterrupted Congress rule since Independence, caste and its enumeration became feeble cries in parliamentary debates. Post-Mandal scenario However, wrangles around caste and the politics of recognition resurfaced in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s with the Mandal Commission. The commission recommended expanding reservation for government jobs to include ‘backward classes’, based on the 1931 census data collated by the colonial government. In his early political career in the 1970s, much before he left the Congress party, V.P. Singh had marked his support for the Commission and his advocacy for caste-based affirmative action. Such discussions were closely related to discussions about the collection of caste data. File photo. B.P. Mandal submitting copies of the Mandal Commission report to Gyani Zail Singh, former President of India. At the peak of the movement, Kanshiram in his batty retorts personified that the census as a much-needed “social surgery” whereby the “backward classes would be given their due share”.  After much delay, finally, in 1990, the implementation of the Mandal Commission resulted in the introduction of OBC reservations. The Mandal Commission estimated the OBC population at 52%. The BJP was staunchly opposed to the Commission and its recommendations. Advani, who at this time went about rabble-rousing the masses with the ‘rath yatra’ that culminated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid, patronisingly caricatured the recommendations as “well-intentioned” but emphasised that reservations were “diluting the emphasis on merit-based selection”. Also read: 30 Years On, Mandal Commission Is Still a Mirror for India For the Congress, even as its broad rhetoric scrawled in favour of caste enumeration for affirmative action, there were elusive opinions afloat on a complete caste census. Post-Mandal, the party faced a complex political landscape and its stance became entangled with electoral considerations. Considerations of potential electoral implications implied that the Congress party had to ‘balance’ the interests of various social groups. Given this history, the recent fervour surrounding the Bihar caste census serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between electoral concerns and actual attempts by the state to ameliorate social inequities. Indeed, in a country where caste-based voting blocs play a crucial role in electoral outcomes, a caste census could open a Pandora’s box. After all, enumeration is also a process of creation, standardisation and reification. Stance of the BJP Simultaneously, within the present-day state that has sought to broaden its reach and increase the legibility of its population, the omission of caste as a categorisation is puzzling. Citizens today are required to possess a never-ending list of documents to ‘prove’ their identity to the state: Aadhaars, ration cards, passports, civil registers, and various types of censuses. Yet, despite this increased enumerative logic, caste – which remains, in many ways, a primary logic of identity construction in India – has remained as elusive as ever. The absence of data makes it impossible to account for the ever-worsening social inequities in the nation. Evasion around discussions of enumerating caste, citing uneven state capacity, was possible in the early years of Independence. This is not the case anymore. With the increase in the many ways the state has attempted to expand every other form of enumeration, it is clear that incentives to omit caste as an enumerative category are deeply political and motivated by electoral calculus. In addition to adhering to constitutional mandate (Article 340), statistical enumeration has become all the more important today. Even the Supreme Court, in the M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, 2006 case has demanded that “quantifiable data” was a requisite “to demonstrate backwardness and inadequate representation”. In 2011, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government initiated the Socio-economic and Caste Census (2011), showing how there is a greater willingness, at least from the side of the Congress to collect caste-related data for policy planning and resource allocation. The ruling regime’s reluctance around the Census shows that enumeration will not only fundamentally restructure welfare politics and affirmative action but will also potentially shift the electoral base of political parties. In this context, prominent parties having no fixed position on the census have begun to engineer their politics to finesse shifting demographics and electoral tides.

Khanum Sherwani dedicated her award to the Palestinian journalists killed in the line of duty in Gaza. “Don’t wait for journalists to get killed, support them while they are alive,” she said in her acceptance speech. “Indian journalism is going through its worst phase in history. We are living in a time where journalists are being branded as terrorists and enemies of the nation. While the majority of the mainstream media has become an extension of Narendra Modi’s propaganda machinery, those of us who are still questioning the most powerful people and raising issues of the marginalised [communities] are being punished in the worst possible ways. The people in power are dehumanising journalists to a point where any action against them can be justified. They are being hounded and prosecuted under anti-terror laws,” she said. “But in the last one decade, the rise of alternate media, a byproduct of the demise of legacy media, is good news for democracy. Despite limited resources, and against all odds, platforms like The Wire are doing the crucial job of informing and educating people about their rights and creating a more informed citizenry. Mass movements like the Shaheen Bagh movement and Kisan Andolan are proof that the battle of truth and democracy will be fought, and one day won by our poorest and most marginalised people.” “The people in power and their supporters online and offline attack me and use my religious identity to discredit my work as a journalist. Despite rape and death threats, I remain undettered because my greatest support comes from ordinary viewers like you. But like Ram Chander Chhatrapati, people should not wait for a journalist to get killed, support them while they are alive,” she added. Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who was editor of Poora Sach, published from Sirsa in Haryana, was killed on October 24, 2002. For him, journalism was a mission to take on the high and the mighty who misused their position to the detriment of the common people. Chhatrapati had found incriminating evidence against Dera Sacha Sauda chief, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. He fearlessly published stories until he was murdered on the evening of October 24, 2002. His standing as an impartial and courageous journalist is evident from the recognition accorded by esteemed figures in the field, including notable journalists such as Kuldeep Nayyar, Ravish Kumar, and Urmilesh. They expressed their honour in receiving the Ram Chander Chhatrapati Journalism Award, established by his friends and family posthumously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/economy/real-growth-figures-4-trillion-gdp-hoax-story,Economy,A Look at the Real Growth Figures Amid the $4 Trillion GDP Hoax Story,"New Delhi: Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with the news that India’s GDP crossed the $4 trillion mark – although there wasn’t any official confirmation of this achievement. A screenshot claiming India’s GDP crossed $4 trillion was taken from a YouTube channel, according to news reports. The channel, LiveStream07, claimed that it collated real-time GDP data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 The IMF, however, told BOOM that this is incorrect because they do not collate real-time GDP data. Economists have also said that the Union government’s National Statistical Office is the only official source of data. The numbers for the July-September 2023 quarter will be released on November 30. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis tweeted saying: “This is what visionary, dynamic leadership looks like! That’s what our New India progressing beautifully looks like! Congratulations to our fellow Indians as our Nation crosses the $4 trillion GDP milestone! More power to you, more respect to you Hon PM @narendramodi ji!” This is what dynamic, visionary leadership looks like !

Another two years to go before India becomes the 3rd largest nation in terms of Global GDP by overtaking Japan at $4.4 trillion and Germany at $4.3 trillion. The Tricolour surge continues! Jai Hind.” Claims and promises are commonplace in the rhetoric of governments, particularly in the run-up to elections. For example, the assertion that India will become a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is a focal point in the media, with leaders of the ruling BJP proudly championing it as evidence of the growth and development promised by the Narendra Modi-led administration. Also read: Understanding GDP Growth Through Discrepancies and Why the Major Push Is Not Visible But why boast about a growing GDP? Highlighting a growing GDP is a way to showcase economic success during the current government’s tenure. It suggests that policies and governance have contributed to a robust and expanding economy. A growing economy is often associated with job creation. A rising GDP could convey that the government’s policies have led to increased employment opportunities. And this could be a crucial factor for voters. Therefore, such claims could help establish a growing confidence and a sense of stability among the voters, a crucial aspect for any citizen to vote for a party. A strong GDP also attracts domestic and foreign investments, showing that the country is economically viable. Basically, the news of a strong GDP can influence public perception and confidence that the ruling government is effectively managing the country’s economy. Also read: The Hollowness of the Modi Government’s Tall Claims and Self-Praise on Economy The real growth figures Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the Union government’s goal to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was “more aspirational than a carefully computed one”. Moreover, who will gain if India reaches the $5 trillion economy mark in 2024? Will a $5 trillion economy or a good income and job matter to ordinary Indians, belonging to the lower, lower-middle, and middle class? It is crucial to address the employment needs of the country’s youth. According to Rajan, India’s economy needs to grow by over 8% to meet the job demands of its vast population.  The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data, for July 2022 to June 2023, showed that a significant number of individuals in India are engaging in self-employment or unpaid labour. It also said that India’s unemployment rate has reached a six-year low, standing at 3.2%. 
 So, is unpaid labour boosting India’s employment figures? As many as 57.3% of the workers are now self-employed. This share was 52.2% six years ago. While India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it is also one of the most unequal countries, with rising poverty and an ‘affluent elite’. Premium car sales surge, but entry-level vehicles find fewer buyers; cookie demand grows, while biscuit sales slow; and India is turning into a magnet for luxury brands, but FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sales are undergoing a slowdown – these are telltale signs of a K-shaped, or an uneven, economic recovery. Apart from economic issues such as high inflation and crony capitalism, mental health, majoritarian politics and press freedom also impact the overall growth of the economy. A Deloitte report estimated that Indian companies could suffer a loss of $14 billion a year due to poor mental health among employees. A psychiatrist had told TOI that many Indian psychiatrists are moving abroad for “greener pastures”. And that’s leading to a shortage of psychiatrists in this country. Note that India has 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 population. The desirable number is anything above three psychiatrists per 100,000 people. Economist Jayati Ghosh, in a paper titled Hindutva, Economic Neoliberalism and the Abuse of Economic Statistics in India, explained how the Narendra Modi government’s efforts at implementing the Hindutva agenda adversely affect economic activity. The Wire had reported in April 2021, that a year after the 2019 Delhi riots – which killed 53 people – Muslim families were selling homes and moving out of Northeast Delhi. They sold their houses at low prices – at least 25% below market rates. The PLFS report highlighted that among the major religious groups, only Muslims have experienced a decline in their labour force participation rate and worker population ratio. Separately, there is evidence to support that attacks on press freedom – such as jailing journalists, raiding their homes, shutting down printing presses, and using colonial laws to arrest reporters – have measurable effects on economic growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/government/five-reasons-according-to-reports-why-the-indian-railways-have-gone-off-track,Government,Five Reasons Why the Indian Railways Have Gone Off-Track,"New Delhi: The Indian railways has been facing criticism for prioritising AC coaches over their sleeper counterparts, with concerns raised about poor maintenance and heightened scrutiny regarding accidents – the most recent one in Balasore being one of the most horrific in Indian history. Here are five reasons why the Indian railways has been performing poorly: 1. Poor operating ratio According to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), the finances of the Indian railways slipped into “concern zone” in 2021-’22 as it recorded its worst ever operating ratio of 107.39%. This means that during that year, the Railways spent more than Rs 107 to earn Rs 100. While the government initially tried to blame the pandemic for the railways’ poor financial condition, a report in Scroll shows that the operating ratio worsened sharply around four years before the pandemic in 2016 and has stayed close to 100% since then. “A closer look at the railways books shows that the failure to generate enough revenue surplus is the reason behind the poor shape of its financials,” the report notes. It highlights, with the help of numbers, how critical this failure has proven to be and how wide the deficit is. 2. Misuse of funds Another CAG report from December 2022 showed that funds from the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) – a special fund created by the Narendra Modi government in 2017 to improve railway safety – was spent on foot massagers, crockery, electrical appliances, furniture, winter jackets, computers and escalators, developing gardens, building toilets, paying salaries and bonuses and erecting a flag. The fund should have received Rs 20,000 crore each year – with Rs 15,000 from the Union and Rs 5,000 from the railways’s revenues. However, over a four-year period, the Indian railways was only able to drum up Rs 4,225 crore – leaving a shortfall of Rs 15,775 crore in their contribution. 3. Poor maintenance The national auditor has also pointed out that at the end of 2020-’21, the railways needed to replace old assets worth Rs 94,873 crore from the Depreciation Reserve Fund. Of this, roughly 60% of the funds or Rs 58,459 crore were to be used for renewal of tracks. However, the CAG report says only Rs 671.92 crore or 0.7% of the funds were used. This, when a 2015 white paper by the government said that 4,500 km of track should be renewed annually. Since then, this has not happened in a single year till at least 2021-’22. 4. Overcrowding The Indian Railways has been systematically replacing Sleeper and Second Class coaches with AC coaches in various train services. A report in the Hindu noted that in four pairs of trains operating out of Mangaluru Central Railway Station, one Sleeper Coach each was replaced by an AC 3 tier Economy Class coach each in May this year. Subsequently, an AC 3 tier Economy Class coach was introduced in place of a general Second Class coach each in Bagmati Superfast Express, Rapti Sagar Superfast Express and Muzaffarpur Express in September. Those holding an unreserved ticket to travel in General Coaches also may find it tough to get seats. With a relatively smaller share of people able to afford the higher costs of AC coaches, and in scenarios where alternative arrangements are not possible, incidents of general ticket holders making their way into reserved compartments have become common, the report said. The report also said that zone wise comparison indicated a sharp rise in AC seats in the Central, Northern and Western Railways, while the rise in Southern and Eastern Railways was not that steep. In July, senior officials of the railways told the Hindu that other than reduction in non-AC coaches, the discontinuation of the fully unreserved Jan Sadharan trains after the pandemic was also contributing to overcrowding. These trains were discontinued because of their unprofitability. 5. Lack of punctuality The CAG noted that the number of mail and express trains that were punctual declined from 79% in 2012-’13 to 69.23% in 2018-’19. More recently, the Times of India reported that the average speed of passenger trains in India had declined by more than 5 km per hour as compared to last year. For freight trains, the average speed fell by almost 6 km per hour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/government/calcutta-high-court-justice-bibek-chaudhuri-emergency-judiciary-executive,Government,Calcutta HC Judge Says His Transfer Marks Power Shift From Executive to Judiciary,"New Delhi: Justice Bibek Chaudhuri on Tuesday, November 21, equated his recent transfer from the Calcutta high court to the Patna high court with transfers during the Emergency. Speaking at his farewell hosted by the Calcutta high court, Justice Chaudhuri said, “In 1975, during the Emergency, 16 high court judges were transferred by the executive in one go. After almost 48 years, 24 high court judges have been transferred by the SC collegium in one go.” “I am one of the beginners in the shifting of power from the executive to the judiciary,” Bar and Bench quoted him as saying. Several of the 24 judges across the country who were transferred by the Supreme Court collegium this past August had requested the collegium to either stay their transfer orders or to transfer them to their preferred places. Though a handful of those requests were entertained, the rest were refused. Justice Chaudhuri’s request too was refused by the SC, as were those of two other judges of the Calcutta high court, Justices Shekhar B. Saraf and Lapita Banerji. While Justice Chaudhuri has been transferred to the Patna high court, Justice Saraf and Justice Banerji have been sent to the Allahabad and the Punjab and Haryana high courts respectively. At his farewell speech, Justice Chaudhuri underlined that in 1983, the Union government’s policy mandated that one-third of all high court judges be from outside the state. “By our transfer, it is the beginning of [the] implementation of that policy,” he said. The Union government had also decided that the chief justice of a given high court must come from a different high court. Justice Chaudhuri also referred to Article 222 of the constitution, which deals with the transfer of high court judges, feeling that its provisions should be used sparingly as laid down in several judicial pronouncements. “With all humility, there are judicial pronouncements which lay down that Article 222 be used sparingly. Please consider my case. [During the process of the transfer] I shall not be able to discharge my judicial duties at Patna for many days. This might not happen if all the transferee judges had the chance to work in their native place,” Justice Chaudhuri said according to LiveLaw. News agency PTI reported him as saying that he planned to take four days’ leave in order to make arrangements for his family. Before he was elevated as a judge of the Calcutta high court in 2018, Justice Chaudhuri served as a judicial officer for the government of West Bengal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-explain-unjustifiable-abki-baar-trump-sarkar-call,Politics,Prime Minister Modi Needs To Explain Unjustifiable ‘Abki Baar Trump Sarkar’ Call,"Recently, a milestone laden with immense political consequence was crossed by the United States with the first anniversary of the federal government appointing a special counsel to oversee two criminal probes against former president Donald Trump.  Jack Smith, a long-time federal prosecutor, was appointed to watch over investigations into allegations of transgressing national security and being party to electoral malpractices against Trump. In the year since, the legal dragnet around him has become larger.  Given the seriousness of the charges against Trump, it is now imperative for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain the unprecedented political support he lent to Trump during his visit to the US in September 2019. With Lok Sabha polls due in months, an explanation at least, if not an expression of regret, is warranted at the earliest.  The prime minister owes a statement on record to the people. He must clarify why during that visit he gave the unjustifiable call for “Abki bar, Trump sarkar,” (This time, a Trump administration) – a near replay of his successful 2014 slogan – at the ‘Howdy Modi’ event organised by the Texas India Forum, at Houston. Besides the two cases under Smith’s watch, Trump further stands indicted in an anti-corruption case involving moral turpitude, in New York. He faces trial on charges of paying sex hush money to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress.  Additionally, Trump is also accused of committing extremely grave electoral malpractices in the state of Georgia. This accusation mirrors one of the two federal cases. He also action in the case filed by journalist and author E. Jean Carroll where far-reaching allegations against Trump relate to rape and defamation. Paradoxically, these developments will not impede Trump’s intended candidature in the 2024 presidential polls and are unlikely to prevent him from assuming office in January 2025, if elected. The peculiarity of American jurisprudence is such that in the event of such a development, Trump may well become the first American First Citizen to pardon himself. But this does not permit Modi to remain silent over his grave indiscretion and an error of judgement in 2019. At the time of the visit, Modi was riding a crest after being re-elected with an enhanced majority and he possibly assumed that Trump too would be re-elected.  This reading was further reinforced when the US president visited India in February 2020 and the red carpet was rolled for him in Ahmedabad. It may be recalled that during his two-day visit beginning in Modi’s political bastion, Trump addressed a ‘Namaste Trump’ rally before an unprecedented one lakh plus audience at the Motera stadium (before it was renamed). The rally followed a massive 22 km road show from the city’s airport to the stadium with Trump, his wife Melania and Modi at its head. Tens of thousands of people were lined up on both sides of sanitised streets. Giant billboards were put up for the event, called India Road Show by the city’s municipal corporation.  The event, while Delhi witnessed the most horrifying communal violence in the city’s recent history, was dubbed a rare instance of “two dynamic personalities” coming together for “one momentous occasion.” An explanation from Modi for his inappropriate support to Trump when he had already begun campaigning for the 2020 polls which he eventually lost, is all the more inescapable because Modi has declared that in his re-election bid in 2024, corruption will be one of the principal pillars of the BJP’s electoral plank.  The plethora of raids and cases against the entire gamut of opposition parties and leaders are cited to buttress his claim and Modi is claiming to be a ceaseless crusader against graft. It would thereby be extremely duplicitous if Modi does not explain his error in 2019 in backing Trump. The accusation against Trump in the New York case is that he bought Stormy Daniels’ silence. Because of the seriousness of the charge and prima facie evidence, Trump has become the first former US President to be indicted. He faces as many as 34 felony charges and can be sentenced to a maximum of a staggering 136 years. Donald Trump. Photo: Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.0, Given the enormity of alleged crimes for which Trump faces multiple trials, it is essential for Modi to confess his lack of prior knowledge of the former president’s misdemeanours. Peculiarly, the silence of opposition parties on this matter so far is not just stupefying, but also indicative of their short memories. Modi’s 2019 tour to the US opened with the community summit, Howdy Modi, at Houston, Texas with Trump by his side. A BBC report noted that the “personal-touch diplomacy with Mr Modi’s trademark bear hugs was played to perfection.”  This slogan, modelled on the BJP’s winning 2014 slogan, was claimed to have been picked up from a Trump video aimed at American voters of Indian origin.  Modi was not alone in his choice of hyperbolic praise. Trump too, in his speech, declared that the Indian premier was “one of America’s greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends.” He also endorsed Modi’s performance by declaring that Modi was consistently doing a “truly exceptional job for India” and its citizens. The Congress party criticised Modi at that time for backing Trump. This forced foreign minister S. Jaishankar to assert that the prime minister had not endorsed Trump’s candidature, but merely reiterated words the American president used in a campaign video aimed at the American Indian community. But, for all practical purposes, it appeared that Modi was calling for Trump’s re-election in the impending 2020 polls in the US.  Politically, the most serious charge against Trump is related to electoral malpractice. In August, the former US president was indicted for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The specific charges are attempts to defraud the nation, tampering with witnesses, targeting citizen rights, and obstructing official proceedings. Trump stands accused of being behind the storming and laying siege to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 to prevent the vice president at that time, Mike Pence, from certifying the presidential election in favour of the winner, Joe Biden, the incumbent.  Trump is further accused of pushing efforts to prepare fake elector slates and reverse the results from several states. This played a central role in Trump’s alleged “seven-part plan” to overturn the 2020 election results. Given that in India in recent years, the impartiality of the Election Commission has been questioned, Modi’s decision to disregard Trump’s attempts at subverting the electoral system and not accept his personal miscalculation and injudiciousness will effectively mean that he condones the former President’s attempts.  This will further raise questions about Modi’s commitment to free and fair elections.

https://thewire.in/rights/gadchiroli-maharashtra-mining-protest,Rights,Gadchiroli: Police Arrest 21 After 'Brutal Crackdown' on 8-Month Adivasi Protest Against Mining,"On the morning of November 20, a huge police contingent allegedly surrounded and destroyed the site at Todgatta in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district, where protesters from over 70 Adivasi villages had been peacefully agitating against the six proposed and auctioned iron-ore mines in the district’s Surjagarh area for the last eight months.  According to protesters, police singled out all the main leaders of the protest, forcefully searched their belongings, and upturned their bags. Eight of the movement leaders were then forcefully taken away by helicopter and their phones were confiscated. The eight include Mangesh Naroti, Pradeep Hedo, Sai Kawdo, Gillu Kawdo, Laxman Jetti, Mahadu Kawdo, Nikesh Naroti, and Ganesh Korea.  Police also wrecked and burnt huts in the village, tore down their roofs, and seized the belongings of some protesters.  Moreover, in a video from the site that has been shared on social media, police officers are seen using lathis to intimidate people into remaining silent and preventing any video or camera footage from being shot. Protesters from the ground also mentioned that a brutal lathi charge took place and several of them sustained injuries as a result. Some even lost consciousness after sustaining injuries to the head. Besides the eight leaders, around 25 protesters were taken away in the trucks.  The Todgatta protest site after police action. Photo: By arrangement. The status or whereabouts of those detained were unknown until late on November 20. The Damkondwahi Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, the people’s organisation behind the protest, had said that it suspected that they had been taken to the Gadchiroli district headquarters. It has now been confirmed that the eight leaders as well as the 21 other protesters who were picked up are currently being housed at the Etapalli police station and Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code has been slapped on all of them. Protesters have said that police requested and secured an eight-day custody remand for all 21 who had been arrested. They will be jailed in Chandrapur. However, not much else is known about the situation, except accounts from protesters. The custody remand request filed by the police was also called ‘highly concerning’ by activists, as it claims that the arrested tried to hit and kill the police, had explosives in their possession, and are funded by Maoists – all trumped up, according to the activists. The remand request says police intend to subject those arrested to intense interrogations in order to “uncover where and how they conspired in the related incident, capture the relevant evidence, expose the support being provided by Maoist organisations, and get information on future behaviour of the accused in connection with their severe crime of planting explosives and associating with Maoist organisations.” Also read: ’76 Years After Independence, We Still Fight’: In Gadchiroli, a 150-Day Protest Against Mining Protesters noted that this was a grave human rights violation, and said that they fear for the wellbeing of those arrested and have demanded that they be released immediately. Justification The police has justified its actions by claiming, “Maoist-influenced and deceived agitators allegedly stopped the way of security personnel from Gatta along with C-60 teams, a special anti-Maoist commando force of Maharashtra, who were all going towards Wangeturi through Todgatta to inaugurate a police station at Wangeturi on Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border.” The Gadchiroli police further claimed that some locals had complained to them that they were being forced to sit on the protest by Maoists and that because they were tired of the Maoist led-protest, they themselves removed the huts at the protest site. Police thus claimed that its personnel did not do any vandalism. However, video and camera footage, in addition to information received from detained protesters and villagers, tell us otherwise. Furthermore, representatives of the protest in Delhi further stated that the gathering at Todgatta was a peaceful one, to solely protest against the proposed mines and the illegal repression they brought in their wake.

In fact, a 2018 fact-finding report by the Coordination of Democratic Rights Organisations, which examined state-sponsored oppression in Gadchiroli, noted that the mining company, the local administration and the Central Reserve Police Force in Etapalli all work together, as reported in Scroll.in in September.  It said, “A parallel system was being set up around the red soiled hills of Surjagarh that would wreak havoc in the lives of the locals. Security camps were built and additional battalions of specially trained police and security forces were deployed in the area. All this was done in the name of anti-Naxal operations, as there has been a history of armed resistance in the area.”  “The government is forcefully constructing police stations without taking the permission of gram sabhas,” protesters told NewsLaundry earlier this year in June. “This month they constructed a police station at Peepliburgi and have plans to bring more police stations at Todgatta, Morewada, Gardewada and Jharewada, among others.”  Security forces constantly threaten villagers over their opposition to mining, interrogating them on their whereabouts in the name of fighting Maoists or Naxalites. “This is a form of mental harassment that has been ongoing for decades,” Mangesh Naroti, one of the leaders of the movement, had told Scroll.in. The Todgatta protest site before police arrived. Photo: By arrangement. Key protesters who requested anonymity told The Wire that over the past two days, the state had been using drone cameras over the protest site to ensure constant surveillance over the region and peoples’ activities, and therefore, knew the exact movements and names of all of the leaders of the protest.  Movements leaders believe that yesterday’s crackdown was a timed attack after the police learnt that activists like advocate Lalsu Nogoti, along with Sushila Naroti, Rakesh Alam, Poonam Jetti, Vandu Uike, and Sainu Hichami would be travelling to represent their movement at a public meeting and press conference in New Delhi at the Press Club of India. The conference, titled “Anti-Displacement Movement and State Repression” and organised by the Forum Against Corporatisation and Militarisation (FACAM), saw powerful statements from across the country and a detailed booklet outlining the issues of mining and repression, and resistance in Surjagarh was released.  Poonam Jetti, a village Sarpanch, spoke about how any act of questioning mining or police activities leads to being labelled as “Naxal” or “Maoist”. Advocate Nogoti stated that a peaceful protest is often mis-labelled as “Naxal-sponsored” to hide a nexus of crony capitalism that trickles down to local administration and affects villagers most significantly. The protest now The brutal suppression came only a few weeks after the protest and demands at Todgatta were voiced internationally on October 8, 2023 by advocate Nogoti, at the 54th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), at Geneva in Switzerland. Nogoti spoke through a video statement in a General Debate Council Meeting under Agenda Item 9, which covers Durban Declaration and Program of Action.  The six proposed mines spanning 4,684 hectares were recently leased through a composite mining lease to five companies: Omsairam Steels and Alloys Private Limited, JSW Steels Limited, Sunflag Iron and Steel Company Limited, Universal Industrial Equipment and Technical Services Private Limited, and Natural Resources Energy Private Limited. All six mines encroach upon the land already granted to people from surrounding Adivasi villages as part of their community forest rights land under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. According to a local study, at least 40,900 people will be displaced if these mines come into existence.  Since March 11, 2023, villagers from across the Surjagad and Damkondwahi pattis/ilakas (areas) have been indefinitely protesting under the banners of the “Damkondawahi Bachao Sangharsh Samiti” and “Surjagarh Patti Paramparik Gotul Samiti”. The protest is being led by the Madia-Gond Adivasi community, one of the three Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) from the state. Representatives from over 70 villages have been taking turns to occupy a stretch of land in Todgatta, thereby making the resistance viable for the long term. The red waters of Todgatta.

Along with huge intergenerational and cross-regional impacts on an entire way of life, knowledge systems, and illegal dispossession of jal, jangal, zameen, there are also many health related impacts of the mines that people are protesting against. Impact of the iron-ore mines  The Lloyd’s iron-ore mine has had a tremendous impact on agriculture, the ecosystem, and the health of Surjagarh’s residents. The region is polluted by red iron oxide discharge, chemical effluents, and large amounts of debris. The fresh water in the region has turned red and is unusable and agricultural fields are overrun by silt. An Adivasi farmer, Ajay Toppo, died by suicide in 2022, after what many believe was prolonged suffering he underwent due to the changes in his farmland.  People have been known to suffer from various diseases such as catharsis, dehydration and gastro-intestinal irritation. Locals say iron ore can interfere with normal body fluid regulation even long after a mine has been closed. According to a report on the hazardous effects of iron oxide on human health, exposure to iron oxide fumes and iron ore dust can cause metal fume fever, which is a flu-like illness with symptoms of metallic taste, fever and chills, aches, chest tightness and cough. Moreover, prolonged or repeated contact can discolour the eyes causing permanent Iron staining. Repeated exposure to iron oxide fumes or dust could also cause pneumoconiosis (siderosis) with cough and shortness of breath. People have reported that the iron contamination has also affected the health of animals and livestock, and has therefore, severely impacted livelihood and income.

https://thewire.in/religion/lingayat-karnataka-hindutva-ganapati,Religion,Ganapati Becomes a New Flashpoint in Karnataka’s Hindutva Politics,"Bengaluru: On November 2, a prominent Lingayat swami asked his community to stop worshipping Ganapati and unwittingly set off a huge controversy. “Ganapati is not Lingayat culture. Instead of starting events with a prayer to him, Lingayats should sing Vachanas,” said Panditaradhya Shivacharya Swami of the Sanehalli matha in Chitradurga district of Karnataka. Vachanas, simple prose-poems composed by founding fathers of the Lingayat movement, are the religious scriptures of the community. Lingayats are descendants of a band of reformers led by Basavanna, who rejected Vedic norms and tried to form an egalitarian, inclusive society in 12th-century Karnataka. The largely working class movement, which drew members from all castes, was crushed by the establishment and the tragic memory is burnt into the Lingayat mind. Basavanna’s emotional appeal cuts across caste and religion in Karnataka and several backward groups in Karnataka trace their social origin to the 12th-century movement. Though over the centuries Lingayats have relapsed into many Hindu practices, a small but influential section of them is seeking to revive the distinct radical ethos of the founding movement and claim a separate religious status for the community. Panditaradhya swami along with many other Lingayat religious leaders have opposed the worship of Hindu gods by the community for decades. Many of them routinely persuade their followers to empty their homes of idols and photos of Hindu gods. But for some reason the November 2 statement caught the attention of Hindutva advocates, who decided to go after him. A police complaint was filed for hurting religious sentiments, TV channels gave the controversy breathless coverage, and a Sangh parivar-affiliated Kannada newspaper ran a continuous campaign for nine days publishing as many as 12 reports on the issue either on the front page or on the opinion page or on both. They asked him to apologise for “offending” the Sanatani religion and respect the plural nature of Indian society. One report spoke of an internationally funded conspiracy to undermine Hinduism. He was described as ‘shameless’, ‘mentally disturbed,’ ‘lefty,’ and a ‘Naxal’ in these reports. Also read: How Karnataka’s Lingayat Community was First Hinduised and Then Hindutvaised Panditaradhya swami is widely seen as a progressive religious leader as he often asks his followers to grow a scientific temper, reject astrology and stop accepting puranas as gospels. He takes up the causes of weaker sections and enjoys a large following outside Lingayats. He has been organising a popular theatre festival every year for decades in which socially sensitive plays are prioritised. He is a strong advocate for a separate Lingayat religion and bringing back Basavanna’s teachings is the central theme of his work. After the media campaign against him started, Lingayat groups interpreted it as an Hindutva attack on Basava philosophy and came out in support. Former IAS officer S.M. Jamdar said, “Many Lingayats especially Veerashaivas worship Hindu gods due to the influence of their neighbours. The Swamiji was right in questioning them.” Jamdar is the secretary of Jagathika Lingayata Mahasabha (JLM), which is spearheading the fight for a separate Lingayat religion. He says the swami’s comments were made at a Lingayat function and were for Lingayats only. “There is no need for others to get upset. We condemn the intemperate attack on him in equally strong words,” he added. The older and more resourceful community organisation All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (AIVM) refrained from issuing a public statement but indicated they were with the swami. Its secretary Renuka Prasanna said, “ The swamiji spoke the truth, we don’t start any programme with a Ganapati prayer. There is no question of not supporting him, if required we will also hit the streets.” AIVM is more conservative, ambivalent on a separate Lingayat religion and at loggerheads with the JLM. In response to the campaign against Panditaradhya swami, Lingayat groups staged sporadic protests, launched a counter media campaign and started flooding social media with explicitly anti-Vedic Vachanas. Many left-leaning progressive activists also joined in and on November 22, both groups are coming together to support the swami at an event in Bangalore. As many as six well known Lingayat religious leaders came out in support of the Panditaradhya swami. The lone exception was Dr Shivamurthy Shivacharya Swami of the powerful Sirigere matha, who opposed ‘fundamentalists’ and said there was nothing in Vachanas that went against Vedas. “The Sirigere Swamiji happens to be Panditaradhya swamiji’s senior in the matha hierarchy and has been at loggerheads with his junior for years. It is unfortunate that he is using this opportunity to settle scores,” said Jamdar. “It is not right to pick a few Vachanas selectively and misinterpret them. It was not just Basavanna…Many like Allama Prabhu, Siddarama, Ambigara Chowdaiah rejected Vedas without mincing words,” Jamdar added. Also read: In Lingayat-Veerashaiva Row, a History of Dissent and Assimilation The relationship between Lingayats and Hinduism is long debated. Though usually seen as a Shaivite community, the Lingayat Shiva does not reside in Kailasa nor is he married to Parvati or is the creator of Ganesha. He is a formless divine energy that is manifest in the Ishtalinga, which Lingayats carry and worship. Though Lingayat beliefs prohibit polytheism, most people in the community do exactly that and the groups fighting for separate religion are locked in a constant battle to discourage the practice. The Ganapati controversy that has grabbed headlines for nearly two weeks in Karnataka underlines the challenges before the Hindutva advocates in the state. In the May 2023 state election, the BJP slumped from 104 to 66 MLAs – and not just due to bad governance and inflation. It also ran into tough ideological opposition from Muslims, Dalits, many backward castes and the JLM Lingayats. The dissent of Lingayats is probably more damaging for the BJP as the community constitutes its primary vote bank. J.S. Patil, a full-time JLM activist, points out that while Lingayats may vote for the BJP, it is largely due to political expediency rather than any ideological commitment. “We are always aware that we are in an intense power struggle with the Sangh parivar within the BJP,” he said. While Hindutva advocates may see the Ganapati controversy as an existential threat, Lingayat activists see it as an opportunity. “We have to thank Hindutva groups with folded hands for creating this controversy and energising us. We need one controversy like this every year to keep our fight going,” said Prasanna Alanahalli, an activist in Mysuru.

https://thewire.in/politics/as-trade-unionist-parliamentarian-basudeb-acharia-dedicated-his-life-to-working-classes,Politics,"As Trade Unionist, Parliamentarian, Basudeb Acharia Dedicated His Life to Working Classes","With the demise of Comrade Basudeb Acharia, the working class lost one of the finest leaders who dedicated his life towards the betterment of the working class. Acharia (81) breathed his last on November 13. Unlike many bourgeoisie trade union leaders, he never used trade union activities for his personal gains. He had deep sympathy for the suffering working people and tried his best to reduce their pain. He was one of the most prominent leaders of the coal mine workers union and railway workers union. He was active in the Raniganj Coal mine and Dhanbad Coal mine area, establishing Mazdoor Union as its vice president. He also served as the president of the All India Coal Workers Federation. His decades-long efforts brought about a positive turnaround in the lives of coal mine workers. Alongside, he also worked towards strengthening the Steel Employees Union and also contributed towards mordenising Durgapur Steel Factory by pursuing Union government. He also helped the Railway Workers Union and led them in many struggles to improve their fate. He worked hard during the railway strikes in 1974 and was arrested and jailed for organising the strike. He also organised insurance agent contract workers in the country. His contribution towards building the Bank Employees Movement is remarkable. The Grameen Bank employees also worked under his guidance. He worked also for the CESE Employees Union and ESTC union while helping the electricity struggle.  He was the president of the LIC Agents Union. He also helped the Calcutta Port Trust Union, in their movements. He also helped in building the Pearless Employees Union through his remarkable contributions. He joined the All India Reserve Bank Employees Movement many times. Building many trade unions and leading their struggle, he became an important leader of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and became its all-India vice president. As CITU leader, he also organised the workers of Damodar Valley Corporation under DVC Shramik Union and contract workers in the Railways, the Thermal Power Station, Cement Industry. Immense contribution as a parliamentarian  Not only had he worked for the trade union movement, but his contribution as a parliament member was also immense towards the cause of working-class people. During his three and half decades of work as an MP, he brought hundreds of workers’ issues to the forefront in the Lok Sabha. No MP had raised so many trade union and working-class issues in the parliament, in a number of ways. Almost every day during the parliament session, he would raise one or other workers’ issues. He contributed to all the labour-related laws brought in the Lok Sabha during those three and half decades. He commanded the respect of the House for his great role. Acharia and I began working as MPs in the Lok Sabha in the 1980s, which continued for the next three decades. His dedication towards the parliamentary work was unprecedented. During that period, there was not a single issue on which he did not submit a notice to the speaker under different rules and zero hours. He was almost a permanent member of the Railway Standing Committee, and served as the chairman of that committee for a long time. His knowledge of railways was remarkable, sometimes even better than the railway ministers. His speeches on the railway budget, issues and accidents, workers’ and employees’ issues would be the single largest volume of records. He brought many changes in the railways through his recommendation as the chairman of the Railway Standing Committee. His attendance in the parliament was at its highest, as he would stay throughout the session, starting from 11 am towards the end of every day’s session. He used every opportunity, under different parliamentary rules, to intervene on various public issues to contribute to the legislative debate. He was also on important parliamentary committees like the Public Undertaking Committee, Committees on Government Assurance, Committee on Petition, Committee on Agriculture, among others. He brought many Private Members’ Bills to the House, many of which were accepted by the governments and were brought out as Bills later. He made a large number of suggestions which led to the amendments in various Bills throughout his parliamentary career. He made it a point to meet ministers every day on people’s issues. Sometimes, he also led delegations of students, workers, peasants, youth, women, among others to meet ministers concerned to press for the resolution of their issues. While other MPs did that too, there was no comparison to the level at which Acharia had done. His busy schedule never restricted him from raising public issues with ministers. His official residence always teemed with people from all walks of life who reached out to him for help. Acharia ensured that he listened to each of them patiently. While he was firm in commitment towards the causes he believed in, he was soft in his nature, exuding qualifies of the highest morality, integrity, and honesty. He walked the talk on any public issue he took up. Besides being a trade union and workers’ leader, he took up farmers’ issues consistently both in the parliament and outside, emphasising the need for the implementation of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee’s recommendation on remunerative price. His role in the enactment of the pro-farmer Land  Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement legislation earned him wide respect across all farmers’ groups. He stood up for the rights of farmers and dependants on land by moving numerous amendments to the Bill. He was a strong voice on the issue of the rights of agricultural labour and for the effective implementation of the MNREGA as well as the Forest Rights Acts. He played a pioneering role in organising silk farmers and workers and took up their issues with the government and the Central Silk Board. On the problem of sugarcane farmers and their mounting arrears, he addressed many of their protests. As a chairperson of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, he raised his voice against corporatisation of agriculture, against the dismantling of the extension services, public stockholding, and efforts to privatise the Food Corporation of India. The report on GM crops tabled during his tenure stressed that the regulatory system in India is inadequate, needs more robust, ensures adequate security as well as control over monopolies and cannot ignore concerns like biosafety biodiversity, food sovereignty and farmers’ livelihood. Archaria’s family came from South Tamil Nadu’s Tirunelveli. His forefather came to ‘Gadi Berh’ of the Purulia district in West Bengal, as the Gadi Berh Panchakot Royal family brought them as the Royal priest. His family then adopted the Bengali language and culture. Basudeb’s wife was also from a Tamil family. Basudeb was born on July 11, 1942, in Purulia. He was involved in politics during his student life. He joined as a teacher at Kashipur Panchakot Raj High School. Later on, he left his job and became whole timer. He was a leader of the teachers’ movement in the Purulia district and state level and, a leader of ABTA. Then he was involved in the Labour movement, especially in the Coal miners’ organisation and also the Railway Worker Union. He joined CPI(M) and was elected to the Purulia District Committee in 1981 and to the West Bengal State Committee in 1985. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 2005 and Chairman of the Control Commission in 2018. He remained in the party till his last day. His parliamentary career was long and glorious. He was elected to Lok Sabha in 1980 from Bankura and re-elected a total of nine times till 2014. He was the leader of the CPI (M) group in Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2014. He played an important role as the chairman of many important Parliamentary Standing Committees as stated earlier. He was a man of the soil. He was very popular among people in Purulia and Bankura. His place of work was Addra-Kashipur and he was known as “Sir” in the district. He played an important role in building Kashipur Maichel Madhusudan Medical College. He moved in his area widely on a motorcycle or local train, without any security. People irrespective of political affiliation had easy access to him, and he never discriminated any anyone. He always looked at the party organisation in his district, took political classes, and helped the mass organisation and panchayats. In times of political violence, he stood by his cadres.  In the 2018 panchayat election, our candidates could not submit nominations. He took all the candidates and went to submit nominations. The TMC workers attacked him and he was badly injured but he never retreated from any terror. He was always a source of courage and inspiration to the cadres and people. I worked with him in close coordination for more than four decades and watched him in action. In parliament, he was always friendly, cordial, and gentle with all members irrespective of party affiliation and loved by all including the staff of parliament. I was surprised by his energy to work around the clock.  He did justice to all his work in the parliament, in his constituencies, in hundreds of trade union struggles, attending to each problem of people and helping them. People would come to see him from all over India in hundreds, but he never showed annoyance, or left unattended. This was the source of his immense popularity. He lived a very simple life and maintained a Communist standard in his life and behaviour. He widely travelled the whole country to attend meetings, conferences, or to participate in struggles to visit if people were attacked by police or affected by communal and caste riots. And the next day he would raise the issue in parliament. Despite his ill health, he never shied away from work. After retirement from the parliament, he was fully engaged in organisational activities of the party, trade union or social work. He would read Marxist literature and party literature regularly to keep himself updated and inspired. His family has been living in Hyderabad for the last few years. Recently he was very ill due to age-related diseases and was admitted to a private hospital. But finally, he passed away on November 13 at the age of 81 years. A few months back his wife had also passed away. He left behind his one son and two daughters and lakhs of comrades, friends, sympathizers and followers. Hannan Mollah is a member of the CPI (M) politburo, and was also elected to the Lok Sabha eight times. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/caste/bihar-caste-survey-the-whos-who-in-the-data-kamar,Caste,Bihar Caste Survey: The Who’s Who in the Data | Kamar,"Beyond politics, the Bihar caste survey is a revolutionary document. A public document, the first ever after 1931, allowing for people to stand up and be counted. We go down to the wire, on what each of the numbers unveiled mean. Who are the people referred to by percentages in the survey? Today we look at Kamar (8,21,103 people). § Who assigned names to castes? The one who created them is perhaps the only one who can answer this question. There are many castes whose names make their status or occupation self-evident. For instance, the term Brahmin evokes a sense of honour. Similarly, Kayastha also appears to be a special word. Bhumihar is another such name which is a combination of ‘bhoomi’ (land) with the suffix ‘har’, making it obvious that the members of this caste are involved in agriculture. Another caste is Rajput, which must include those who belong to the ruling class. Illustration: Pariplab Chakraborty They are also a symbol of social prestige. Since the above-mentioned four names are upper castes, their names are indicative of prestige. As far as the remaining castes are concerned, there is no such caste whose name evokes respect. Koeris have now started calling themselves Kushwaha after the name of Kush, son of Ram. The people of the Bhar caste have also started identifying themselves as Rajbhar. Similarly, the people of the Ramani/Kahar caste now refer to their caste as Chandravanshi while the people of the Chamar caste call themselves Ravidas. There is no one in the world who does not crave for a respectable place in society. But this hunger for respect has deeper implications. There is a caste in Bihar called Kamar. Though Chamar and Kamar differ in the first syllable in their names, they have innumerable similarities. For example, the Chamar caste is a craftsman caste that makes all kinds of items from the skin of dead animals – from the king’s armour to his shoes. All sound amplifying instruments have been made by the people of Chamar caste. But the Kamar people do not lag behind. They have offered many gifts to human civilisation through their craftsmanship. If you have ever lived in a village, any object you see made of wood or iron is owing to them. Hence, Kamar is both a carpenter and a blacksmith. In fact, Kamar is a group that includes three communities – blacksmiths, carpenters and karmakar. Here, karmakar is a completely new word and there are political and social reasons behind it. But before we explain this, it is important to note that even today human life cannot be imagined without the contribution of this caste. Whether it is a bed to sleep in, a cot, a stool or items in the kitchen, or even the bier on which a deceased person’s body is placed and carried to the cremation ground, all of this is made by these people. The fact is that two things have been done with the creation of castes. Firstly, the people of upper castes reserved respect for themselves, and secondly, the labour of the lower castes was devalued. They were told what their job was and that they did not deserve respect. For example, the one who provided clean clothes to the society was insulted by being called a dhobi; those who reared cows and buffaloes were called Gwala or Gowar; those who worked in leather were called Chamars and those who worked with iron and wood were called Kamars. And thus, their hard work was ridiculed and devalued. So basically the caste system is founded upon the principles of denial of unity and devaluation of labour. But this was prior to 1990 – a year which was indeed remarkable for all the artisan and farming communities of India. It was during this year that the recommendations of the Mandal Commission came into effect. One of its results was that a provision of 27% reservation was made for backward castes in government jobs. But its social impact was very deep. With this single step a social revolution erupted in India, which changed the etymology with Kamar being called Karmakar and Chamar being called Charmkar. But it is no less than a conspiracy that the government is giving credit for their labour and skill to the Hindu god Vishwakarma, even though their skill and hard work are their own. Actually, the political conspiracy behind dividing the people of Kamar caste into carpenters, blacksmiths and Kamar is that the ruling class does not want to see these people united. The most recent and official evidence is the Caste Based Enumeration Report-2022 released by the Bihar government, which says that the population of Kamar (lohar and Karmakar) is 8,21,103. The report also states that the population of the Badhai (carpenter) caste is 18,95,672. Now if we add these two figures, the total population of these people in Bihar is 27,16,775. This number is more than three times the total number of Kayasthas in Bihar, which is 7,85,771. But their participation in governance is absolutely nil. In the name of resources, they have only hammers, chisels, augers, trowels and saws. The Bihar government has included these people in the category of extremely backward classes. But is that what these people deserve? Translated from Hindi by Naushin Rehman. Read the Hindi original here.

https://thewire.in/law/misleading-advertisements-fine-false-cure-claims-supreme-court-patanjali,Law,Stop Misleading Advertisements or Face Rs 1 Crore Cost for False Cure Claims: SC to Patanjali,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday, November 21, asked Patanjali Ayurved to immediately stop publishing misleading claims and advertisements against modern systems of medicine, warning of a hefty fine if it does not. According to LiveLaw, the bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Prashant Kumar Mishra was considering a petition filed by the Indian Medical Association against misleading advertisements. “All such false and misleading advertisements of Patanjali Ayurved have to stop immediately. The court will take any such infraction very seriously, and the court will also consider imposing costs to the extent of Rs 1 crore on every product regarding which a false claim is made that it can ‘cure’ a particular disease,” Justice Amanullah orally said. The court directed Patanjali Ayurved not to publish any such advertisements in the future and to ensure that casual statements are not made to the media. The bench said the issue was not “allopathy vs ayurveda” but to find a real solution to the problem of misleading medical advertisements, according to LiveLaw. The bench told additional solicitor general K.M. Nataraj, appearing for the Union Government, to find a “viable solution” for the problem and come up with suitable recommendations after consultations. The matter will be considered again on February 5, 2024. The petition was filed in mid-2022 after Patanjali published an advertisement in July that the IMA said sought to “promote traditional medicine by disparaging allopathy” and a “continuous, systematic, and unabated spread of misinformation” regarding allopathy. Last year, issuing notice, the court pulled up Baba Ramdev. “What happened to Baba Ramdev? He can popularise his system, but why should he criticise other systems. We all respect him, he popularised yoga but he shouldn’t criticise other systems. What is the guarantee that his system will work? He cannot refuse doctor system. He must exercise restraint in abusing other systems,” said then Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana. The IMA petition says even though the Ministry of AYUSH has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) for monitoring misleading advertisements of AYUSH drugs, Patanjali has continued its “disregard for the law, violating the mandate with impunity.” In a separate case, the Delhi high court last year told Baba Ramdev not to “mislead” people against allopathy and not to make any claims beyond what authorities had stated about Patanjali’s product Coronil. The court took exception to Patanjali advertising it as a “cure” for COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/rights/watch-plastic-rice-delhis-experiment-with-fortified-rice-hard-to-swallow-for-indias-adivasi-residents,Rights,"Watch | ""Plastic Rice"": Delhi’s Experiment With Fortified Rice Hard to Swallow for India's Adivasi Residents","Jharkhand and Odisha’s rice and vegetable growing small cultivators question the logic of the top-down nutrition fix for residents in the form of mandatory rice fortification. Rural Adivasi residents of Odisha and Jharkhand question the new rice being distributed to them as food subsidies in the public distribution system. The government is adding synthetic micronutrients – iron, Vitamin B and folic acid – as a potential solution to malnourishment and anaemia. But even after a few months – and in some sites even a year – of distributing this new fortified rice, the residents do not trust it for its artificial appearance and lack of consistency. They are rice growers themselves and reject this rice as lacking the inherent qualities of rice: its texture, colour, taste etc. In the Chhotanagpur region, historically farmers have grown hundreds of indigenous varieties of rice, some of which are even more nutritious than this new fortified rice. But both the reduction in these varieties, as well as industrial processing systems over the decades have been reducing the nutrition on their plates. At the same time, the rice farmers remain reluctant to accept the new fortified rice as part of their everyday diets. For more information, read The Wire‘s series.

https://thewire.in/government/renaming-rebranding-bjp-policies-schemes-upa,Government,Renaming and Rebranding: The Story of BJP’s Policies and Schemes,"When Congressman Shashi Tharoor complained in a tweet once that the BJP had merely changed the names of 23 Congress schemes, and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was running a “name-changing” government and not a “game-changing one”, his claim was put to the test. It was found that he was right about 19 schemes. It turned out that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was the UPA’s Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account; the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana was the same as the National Girl Child Day programme; the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana was the Rajiv Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana; the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation was the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission renamed; the BJP’s neem-coated urea was the same as the Congress’ neem-coated urea; the Soil Health Card scheme was the National Project on Management of Soil Health and Fertility; the Atal Pension Yojana was the Swavalamban Yojana; and even Mr Modi’s flagship “Make in India” was merely the National Manufacturing Policy (NMP) under a new name. And it was not mere renaming; the entire policy framework in many cases was also a copy-paste job, as a comparison of the department for promotion of industry and internal trade’s press note (2011) and the Make in India website page on national manufacturing showed. The UPA’s NMP scheme spoke of “enhancing the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25% within a decade and creating 100 million jobs”. Make in India seeks “an increase in the share of manufacturing in the country’s GDP to 25%” and to “create 100 million additional jobs by 2022 in manufacturing”. The UPA’s NMP says it will “increase manufacturing sector growth to 12-14% over the medium term”. Make in India says it will “increase in manufacturing sector growth to 12-14% over the medium term”. The NMP says the policy needs “creation of appropriate skill sets among the rural migrant and urban poor to make growth inclusive”. Make in India says it needs “creation of appropriate skill sets among rural migrants and the urban poor for inclusive growth”. The UPA NMP policy says it will “increase domestic value addition and technological depth in manufacturing”. Make in India says it will “increase domestic value addition and technological depth”. In fact, the Make in India website not only reflected the Congress scheme but a broken download link also unsuccessfully directed readers to a 2011 document of the older policy. Elsewhere, Digital India was the same as the earlier National eGovernance Plan; Skill India the same as the National Skill Development Programme; Mission Indradhanush was the Universal Immunisation Programme; and PAHAL the earlier Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG. BharatNet was the National Optic Fibre Network approved on October 25, 2011, aiming to provide broadband connectivity to all panchayats. When the Rajiv Awaas Yojana was renamed the Sardar Patel National Urban Housing Mission, it came with a claim from then housing and urban poverty alleviation minister M. Venkaiah Naidu that housing for all would come by 2022. A parliamentary committee, headed by BJD MP Pinaki Mishra, asked the government how merely changing the name could accelerate implementation. This went largely unreported. The reality is that the UPA’s schemes had anodyne and unmemorable names even though they had the same aims. Modi’s schemes have catchier names because he spends so much effort personally polishing coinage. A friend observed that Modi’s schemes targeted at the wealthy had English names – Digital India, Skill India, Start-up India, Make in India – signalling aspiration. However, the schemes for the poor were in Hindi – Ujjwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Beti Padhao Beti Bachao, Jan Dhan, Garib Kalyan, PM Kisan, Mudra Yojana – reflecting the branding priority. Not as much effort on implementation though: Make in India’s target was shifted from 2022 to 2025 as manufacturing collapsed in India, and instead of going from 16% in 2014 to 25% in 2022, in fact dropped to 13% and remained at 13% in 2023. Make in India has a nice logo though. Tharoor’s good-natured acceptance that such things represented continuity (Dr Manmohan Singh did not say a thing about the renaming) sat in contrast with the BJP’s contempt for the very schemes they appropriated. Particular hostility was reserved for the UPA’s Unique Identity scheme: Aadhaar. During the 2014 campaign, a top newspaper ran a headline on March 12, 2014: “Aadhaar a ‘fraud’, will review it if voted to power: BJP”. The party alleged that Aadhaar was a criminal programme and it would have the CBI investigate it. “This is a dangerous programme to regularise the stay of illegal immigrants in the country. Is Bharat Mata so open to illegal immigrants? The Aadhaar is also in contravention of Supreme Court directives,” Meenakshi Lekhi said in Bengaluru while campaigning against Congressman and Aadhaar architect Nandan Nilekani. “The entire biometric data of people enrolled has been stored outside the country,” she added. Nilekani’s opponent, Ananth Kumar (who would eventually win), said: “Aadhaar is the biggest fraud on the country”. The next month, Ananth Kumar said the BJP would scrap Aadhaar. Modi himself weighed in against Aadhaar, saying the money spent on it was wasted, that NREGA was meant to line the pockets of the Congress and that the Right to Information Act was useless. As it turned out, the BJP under Modi would not only embrace Aadhaar, it would also force it upon all Indians, willing or unwilling, as the NDA expanded India’s social welfare schemes, many of which they had inherited and renamed to pretend they were their own.

https://thewire.in/politics/delimitation-should-not-solely-be-determined-by-numerical-superiority-former-sc-judge-chelameswar,Politics,Delimitation Should Not Solely Be Determined by Numerical Superiority: Former SC Judge Chelameswar,"Retired Supreme Court judge Justice Jasti Chelameswar asked whether there should be a pattern where somebody gets a premium for their nonperformance, with the South Indian states paying for the nonperforming states. He was speaking during a panel discussion on “Delimitation: Southern Discomfort And Solutions” at Dakshin Dialogues 2023, the annual flagship thought conclave of South First, in Bengaluru on Saturday, October 7. “The matter of delimitation and ‘One Nation, One Vote’ should be debated seriously. Funds from the government of India are being used for the different states… Some of us in some other parts of the country are not being cared for so well. Something is required to be done. But should it be such a pattern that somebody gets a premium for their non-performance? How to solve it? That’s a matter which should be discussed along the line of delimitation,” said Justice Chelameswar. On amending the constitution He added that the constitution of India was a legal document that deserved the utmost respect: It was crucial not to view it as something infallible, but rather subject to scrutiny and adaptation. This aspect has been a topic of discussion for the past 75 years, from the very beginning when questions arose about whether the constitution could be amended by parliament, he noted. “It was in 1973 that the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution could be amended by parliament, with the limitation that the basic structure of the constitution could not be altered. Defining what constitutes this ‘basic structure’ is a complex task, akin to traditional Indian philosophy – it’s challenging to explain,” he said. However, it was also worth noting that there were aspects of the constitution that might benefit from periodic reevaluation. “What may have been suitable a century ago may require reexamination through rigorous and intelligent debate,” he explained. “The process should not be solely determined by shouting and numerical superiority; it demands thoughtful consideration.”  On interpreting the constitution The framers of the constitution were individuals of great wisdom, with vast experience and deep commitment to the nation, noted the retired Supreme Court judge, adding that many of them endured prolonged periods of incarceration during the British colonial era. Their sacrifices and dedication to the country’s development and democratic principles culminated in the creation of this constitution, he said. “While there are aspects that might warrant reconsideration. I’d like to emphasise that the constitution’s ongoing interpretation and application are essential for its relevance and effectiveness,” he said. “As for the principle of ‘one person, one vote’, it’s indeed a fundamental tenet of democracy. However, it raises questions about how political power, derived from numerical representation, intersects with other crucial aspects like financial distribution. I’m not an economist, but I can provide an example to illustrate this,” he added. He also said there are two high courts in India where the use of Hindi as a language of communication is legally permissible – Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Other states have subsequently joined. “This development occurred in the 1950s when the assemblies passed a resolution, and the government was tasked with notifying Hindi as a language for high courts,” he noted. “It’s important to note that this decision wasn’t influenced by any particular political party. However, despite the resolution, the use of Hindi in high courts has not become widespread. This raises questions about the practical application of such decisions,” he said. Request for Hindi in court He said that he once attended a gathering where the demand was raised to make Hindi an official language for legal documents and court proceedings. Many speakers supported this demand. “When it was my turn, I mentioned that I come from a region where Hindi is not widely spoken, and I had watched numerous Hindi movies. I asked if anyone in the audience had seen even one South Indian movie, irrespective of the language. Surprisingly, not a single person had. My point was that diversity in languages is important, and learning more languages is enriching,” he said. He added that, however, these decisions could be politically influenced. For instance, Hindi-speaking individuals formed a majority in parliament, and this influenced decisions regarding language use. Similarly, election processes should adhere to the constitutional principle that the ratio of representation among states should be roughly equitable.

https://thewire.in/politics/let-ed-live-telecast-sonias-questioning,Politics,Union Govt Should Telecast Sonia Gandhi's ED Interrogation Live: Bhupesh Baghel,"Raipur: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday challenged the BJP government at the Union government, saying if it has courage it should install cameras and live telecast the questioning of Congress president Sonia Gandhi by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. Addressing a protest organised by the Congress in front of the ED office in Chhattisgarh’s capital Raipur, he accused the BJP of misusing central agencies against opposition parties. The ED questioned Gandhi in New Delhi for over two hours in a money laundering case related to the National Herald newspaper. She has been summoned again on July 25. The ED action against Gandhi invited strong reaction from the Congress which staged street protests across the country during which party leaders also courted arrest. Also read: Explainer | Why Has the ED Summoned the Gandhis in the ‘National Herald’ Case? Speaking in local language Chhattisgarhi, Baghel said, “They (ED) should install cameras in the room where they were questioning Sonia Gandhi and share its links to all news channels or allow news channels’ cameras inside the room. The country wants to know their questions and replies by Gandhi. If the BJP government at the Centre has courage, then let the ED put cameras at the place where Sonia Gandhi is being questioned. Do you have that kind of courage? The country wants to know where scam has taken place (in the National Herald case), Baghel asked. The Congress leader said the Modi government has been harassing a 75-year-old woman (Gandhi) who is in poor health by letting the ED summon her to its office. ED officials could have taken a written statement from the Congress president instead of calling her to the office, the CM said. He further asked Why don’t ED officials take action against Chhattisgarh’s former chief minister Raman Singh who faced allegations of corruption.” State Congress Chief Mohan Markam, party MLAs and senior leaders took part in the protest.

https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-jdu-bihar-nitish-kumar-narendra-modi,Politics,Is the End of the Road Near for BJP and JD(U) in Bihar?,"Patna: Nitish Kumar’s decision to not accept ‘symbolic’ representation in the Narendra Modi-led council of ministers may eventually culminate in the break-up of the alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar ahead of the November 2020 assembly elections. The BJP had offered only one berth to each of its allies – including the JD(U) – irrespective of the number of their MPs. In what is being seen as “tit for tat,” Nitish on Sunday expanded his cabinet, inducting as many as eight JD(U) legislators in his ministry and leaving barely one berth for the BJP – which said the “suitable person would be inducted in the ministry later”. The Modi cabinet was sworn in on May 30. Despite the Bihar chief minister leaving the BJP out in the cold, he maintained, “Everything is fine with the NDA. We are part of the NDA and will remain so”. The party general secretary, K.C. Tyagi too said, “We wanted a substantive representation of JD(U) in the Narendra Modi ministry, but the BJP offered only one berth as symbolic representation, which we couldn’t have accepted. But we are in the NDA”. Nitish’s antecedents, however, suggest that he seldom declares a break-up until it has become formal. About three days ahead of breaking up with the BJP in 2013, Nitish had said in the Bihar assembly, “Today we are in the NDA. None among us knows what will happen tomorrow”. Similarly, he had gone to Rajgir for health reasons in July 2017 for about five days without giving any indication that he would dump the Rashtriya Janata Dal. But on his return on July 27, he suddenly resigned as the chief minister, dumping the RJD and soon getting back to the NDA. Political observers feel that Nitish’s utterance that “everything is fine with NDA” was more public posturing. Also read: Tejashwi Yadav Fought the 2019 Elections With 2020 in Mind – and It Backfired In fact, by refusing “proportionate” representation to the JD(U) as wished by its president and Bihar chief minister, the BJP – powered by the brute majority – has not only cornered Nitish but has made clear its intent to push its agenda – one on which Nitish has steadfastly differed. Nitish, in keeping with his nature not to compromise on his core ideological positions and proportionate political share, compelled the BJP to agree on an equal number of seats – 17:17 – to be contested between the BJP and JD(U) in Bihar. They won an almost equal number too – 16 for the JD(U) and 17 for the BJP. Right from the beginning of the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, the JD(U) refused to accept the BJP and Modi as the “bada bhai (elder brother)” and itself as the “chhota bhai (younger brother)”. Despite his limitations as the leader of a regional party, Nitish never got drowned in the BJP’s narrative. For instance, Nitish remained silent when the BJP and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) cadres joined the Vande Mataram chorus led by Modi at election meetings at Darbhanga and Muzaffarpur. BJP chief Amit Shah repeatedly announced at his meetings that his party would end Article 370, build the Ram temple at Ayodhya and implement the uniform civil code – but neither Nitish nor any of his party campaigners supported Shah’s line. Ever since 1996, when Nitish struck an alliance with the BJP, he made it clear to the saffron party – then in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani era – that he would never agree with the BJP on the issues of Article 370, Ram temple and the uniform civil code, but would work with it on mutually accepted common minimum programme for governance. “But there is a world of difference between the Atal-Advani and Modi-Shah periods. The former were still in quest of legitimacy and sought allies via compromise. Now the party (BJP) has a majority on its own”, writes the historian and professor at Ashoka University, Mahesh Rangarajan. Nitish, despite his differences with the BJP on the core issues, conducted himself as an honest ally. He addressed as many as 170 election meetings covering the constituencies of all the 17 BJP candidates and six LJP candidates. He asked for “majdoori (wage)” for his work in terms of the vote while praising Modi for releasing Rs 50,000 crore for the development work in Bihar. Though his party did not bring out its manifesto to ensure that the NDA’s campaign didn’t get affected by the contentious issues between the BJP and JD(U), Nitish never expressed conformity with those issues either. Now with the BJP securing a landslide majority on its own, the Modi-Shah duo is understood to have got the “legitimacy” and “license” to implement its totalitarian agenda that has been “inimical” to the very foundation of the idea of India based on coexistence, plurality and social harmony as envisioned by the founding fathers of India. Also read: Will Being Granted Special Status Solve Bihar’s Problems? The radical Hindutva-laced BJP under Modi-Shah may find the likes of Nitish Kumar as “irritant” in the way of implementing its agenda, and might have thought to remove the JD(U) by giving it token representation. Given his background and political training, “Nitish can’t go with the BJP’s sectarian lines,” said the veteran socialist leader and RJD vice president Shivanand Tiwary who has worked with both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar since the JP movement days. Political observers believe that Nitish has accepted Modi as the prime minister but not his (Nitish’s) leader. Nitish’s leaders and icons continue to be Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan who preached unity in diversity, coexistence and social harmony. After the recent development, the drift between the JD(U) and BJP seems to have widened. Nitish joined the Iftar party hosted by the mahagathbandhan leader Jitan Ram Manjhi but did not turn up at the BJP’s Iftar party. The BJP leaders too didn’t turn up at the Iftar party hosted by Nitish. Nitish and his deputy, Sushil Kumar Modi attended the gathering hosted by LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan but the Bihar chief minister reportedly ignored Sushil Modi. To his advantage, Nitish’s JD(U) has secured 21.8% votes this time from 16.04% in 2014 and the BJP’s vote-share has slid down from 29.40% in 2014 to 23.58% this time. The BJP leaders are claiming that Nitish has benefitted from the Modi wave but the fact remains that he evidently has created a solid base among the extremely backward classes and Mahadalits through his work as well as social engineering. In a way, Nitish might be looking for new allies in face of assembly elections due later next year in Bihar. And the BJP might be looking to gain a majority on its own in the state and replace Nitish with its own chief minister. It is premature to say that all other non-BJP parties would join Nitish, but he has surely begun the exercise to challenge the BJP’s move to establish its unilateral say in Bihar.

Media Matters had published a report claiming ads for major brands had appeared alongside Neo-Nazi and white nationalist posts. X said the report aimed to “drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.” IBM, NBC Universal, and its parent company Comcast, said last week that they had stopped advertising on X after the Media Matters report. This was a new setback for X, which gets most of revenue from advertisements. The platform, formerly known as Twitter, claims Media Matters misrepresented the typical experience on X, with the intention of harm. What does the lawsuit say? The lawsuit, filed in a US District Court in Texas, claimed Media Matters “manipulated” X by using accounts that exclusively followed accounts for major brands or users known to produce fringe content, and “resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing” the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts. Media Matters, a Washington DC-based nonprofit, has called the lawsuit “frivolous.” The nonprofit’s president, Angelo Carusone, said the lawsuit was “meant to bully X’s critics into silence,” and that he was looking forward to winning the case. X said in the lawsuit that ads for IBM, Comcast, and Oracle only appeared alongside hateful content for one viewer, which the social platform claimed was Media Matters. The Media Matters report said ads from Apple and Oracle were also placed next to antisemitic material on X. It also said it found ads from Amazon, NBA Mexico, NBCUniversal and others next to white nationalist hashtags. Since Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion (€40 billion) in October 2022, several advertisers have fled the platform due to Musk’s controversial posts and layoffs. The ad revenue for X has declined at least 55% year-over-year each month since Musk’s takeover, reported Reuters.

He is not a villain. He must be having reasons for what he is doing. He is the only person who can tell us why he is doing it. But he is not here… The ‘villain’ is not being heard. He should come,” Justice Dhulia. The judge’s remarks were in response to submissions made by amicus curiae, senior advocate Aparajita Singh, to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, November 21, that 748 fires were lit across stubbled paddy fields in Punjab on Sunday, November 19, alone. “The Punjab government says it is doing everything. But it is not visible on the ground,” Singh pointed out to the court. Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is heading the Bench, struck a divergent note to that of his fellow judge. He observed that farmers who are violating the law, despite court orders and counselling against stubble-burning, “should feel the pinch”. “Despite court orders and counselling, for their two bit of money and no matter how the fires affect the environment and children, they do it… Why should people who violate the law benefit monetarily?” Justice Kaul asked pointedly. He sought to know from the Punjab and Haryana governments why farmers flouting orders should be considered for minimum support price (MSP). “Take away the incentive,” Justice Kaul said sharply. Justice Dhulia chimed in to underline that MSP is a “sensitive issue”. “There is a representative of everybody here except farmers… Farmers must be here,” Justice Dhulia noted. In response, Justice Kaul said, “People lighting fires will not come here and people following the law need not come here.” Meanwhile, Punjab advocate general, Gurminder Singh, told the court that 8,481 meetings had been held with farmers across the state and that the government pressed into action 1,092 flying squads to prevent stubble burning. Singh also added that so far 980 FIRs had been registered against landowners who violated the norms against setting fires, and over Rs 2 crore had been estimated as environmental compensation due. Justice Kaul, at this stage of the hearing, rued that land in Punjab is becoming arid due to extensive cultivation of paddy. “Somewhere, farmers have to understand the fallout of paddy cultivation… Whether there can be a policy by which you [the government] could discourage paddy and encourage other crops in Punjab… water is becoming scarce and the wells are running dry,” he pointed out. The apex court had earlier, on November 7, ordered the state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to ensure that stubble burning is stopped “forthwith” as an immediate measure to protect the lives and health of people. “Pollution is not a political game where one state shifts the blame to another depending on the ruling political dispensation… This [pollution] is a murder of the health of the people. You see children in Delhi suffering from health issues,” Justice Kaul had said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/video/watch-karan-thapar-pronab-sen-gdp-figure-concern,Video,"Watch | Data on Which GDP Calculated A Major Concern, Soon GDP Could Become Unreliable: Pronab Sen","In a comprehensive interview to discuss concerns about how India calculates its GDP and whether GDP conveys the full picture of the state of the economy and, in particular, the condition of the majority of the country’s population, India’s former chief statistician Pronab Sen has said the data on which India’s GDP is calculated is “a major concern”. He added that if this is not corrected soon, India’s GDP growth figures could become “unreliable”. The key concern identified by Sen, who is also the present Chairman of the Standing Committee on Statistics, is the way the consumer price index (CPI) and the wholesale price index (WPI) are calculated and, specifically, the basket of goods on which they are based. This basket has not changed for 12 years, during which period the consumption patterns of the Indian population have changed dramatically. Therefore, the baskets of goods on which WPI and CPI are based are now almost comprehensively out of date. In a 50-minute interview with Karan Thapar for The Wire, Sen said GDP and the GDP growth figure only convey a partial picture of the state of the economy. They do not reveal high levels of unemployment or increasing demand for the rural employment guarantee scheme NREGA or the fact that 58% of the workforce is self-employed – which he interprets as distress employment. He adds that perhaps as many as 95 million people, who are said to be self-employed, do not earn any income at all. Therefore, when politicians – and sometimes economists – present the GDP growth figure to claim the country is soaring, it doesn’t capture the truth about the majority of the Indian population who are poor.  Sen says he believes the Q1 GDP growth figure of 7.8% is an overestimation. He believes 6.5% is more accurate. In the interview, he explains why he believes the recent Periodic Labour Force Survey finding that 58% of the workforce are self-employed is not an indication of increasing self-entrepreneurship (as claimed by SBI economists) but distress employment. There’s also a substantial discussion about whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi is right to claim India will be a developed country by 2047. Sen says if this means India will achieve the World Bank criteria of per capita income of $13,200, that, he says, is possible. If, however, the prime minister means India will reach the level of the UK’s $45,000, then that is a flat resounding no. Sen adds that even if you reach the World Bank criteria of $13,200 per capita income, India could still have 50% of the workforce self-employed and up to 100 million people earning no income at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tarigami urged the government to halt the import of apples from the US and other countries, as such imports substantially contribute to the decline in prices of domestic produce. Barely two days later, on July 19, reports emerged that the Union government had decided to remove the extra tariff duty on Washington apples. On September 5, the Union finance minister issued an order waiving the 20% additional retaliatory duty levied on premium Washington apples in 2019. The order came on the close heels of a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Joe Biden on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi. Tarigami issued a statement terming the removal of additional duty as Modi’s G20 gift to the US. The newly minted AFFI held conferences in both south and central Kashmir to mount pressure on the government. The federation also put forth a charter of demands before the government. “In September, we met with the Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and presented him a memorandum of demands concerning apple farmers,” said Zahoor Ahamd Rather, president of AFFI (J&K). He added that restrictions and 100% import duty on apples imported from the US and other countries could save the apple farmers. “Such imports are bound to affect the produce from J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” said Rather.
Kashmir produces around two million metric tonnes of apples annually, with around 3.5 million people directly or indirectly relying on the industry for their livelihood. Apple cultivators in the Valley continue to voice their concerns over the import of apples from across the world with low import duties. “Imports from Iran, routed through Afghanistan, coupled with the removal of additional duty on Washington premium apples are impacting domestic produce,” said Mohamamd Ashraf Wani, a local fruit grower and former president of the Fruit Mandi, Shopian. Wani said that Indian apples could not compete with the Washington premium apples. Rather, on the other hand, drew an analogy between Indian and US farmers. “The US farmers receive around 32% subsidy while the subsidy received by domestic farmers [in India] stands at scant 2.5%,” he said. The Department of Horticulture issued statements in an attempt to allay the fears of farmers regarding the apple imports. Director horticulture, Ghulam Rasool Mir, on November 5 told PTI that imports from the US and other countries were not a threat to J& K’s apple industry and they won’t be stopped. Low production Compared to last year, apple production this year is significantly lower, with farmers from the apple-rich districts of Kashmir reporting about a 40% dip in the yield. Izhan Javed, an apple orchardist and spokesperson the J&K Fruit and Vegetables Processing and Integrated Cold Chain Association (JKPICCA), said that the low production was coupled with more C-grade apples. “Around 30% is of lower quality,” said Javed. The erratic weather conditions during the spring are largely being held responsible for the low production and poor quality fruit. Senior scientist at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Kashmir (SKUAST-K) Dr Tariq Rasool said that frequent rains from March to July affected the fruit produce. He said that the rains stymied the movement of pollinators that resulted in low production. “Lower temperature during that period is a key reason for the growth of pests,” said the scientist. He also said that the commonly grown Delicious variety “has an alternate bearing”. “Last year we experienced a bumper crop and this year it was low,” he added. Price drop Following a promising market earlier this year, apple prices have suddenly plummeted over the two weeks. The drop in the prices is attributed to the arrival of thousands of apple cartons from Iran in Indian fruit markets. “The first-rate apples from Iran via Afghanistan have precipitated the price drop. We were happy as the rates this year were comparatively high, but the imported produce has again started taking a toll on local harvest,” said Javed Ahmad, an apple grower. Last month, an apple carton of Grade-A was sold between Rs 1,300 and Rs 1,400 in local fruit mandis. The prices, at the time this article was written, have dipped to Rs 850 to Rs 1,000. Similarly, the prices of Grade-B apples have significantly fallen (from Rs 400-650 to Rs 250-300). Gulzar Bhar is a journalist based in Srinagar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/agriculture/the-hurdles-in-the-way-of-reforming-agricultural-markets-in-india,Agriculture,The Hurdles in the Way of Reforming Agricultural Markets in India,"In November 2021, the parliament repealed the three farm laws enacted in 2020: the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Misinformation about these laws persists, and their repeal is cited as the reason for inflation, shortages, and other multiple problems plaguing Indian agriculture. Sukhpal SinghRegulating Agricultural Markets in India: A Smallholder PerspectiveOrient BlackSwan (October 2023) This book – Regulating Agricultural Markets in India: A Smallholder Perspective – provides a perspective on the enactment and later the repeal of the first two laws. Its author, Sukhpal Singh, is a professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The book is a collection of Singh’s articles published earlier in various reputed publications. This slim volume has only six chapters, of which two are devoted to contract farming and its regulatory framework. A chapter in the book is about the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, which was basically aimed at bypassing the agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) and permitting trade in agricultural produce outside their physical boundaries. This law was the main reason for the 14-month-long farmers’ agitation on Delhi’s borders. The introductory chapter highlights the importance of small and marginal farmers in the agricultural landscape of India. In 2018-19, this class of farmers cultivated only 56% of the area but accounted for 89% of all operational holdings. Even though the official statistics – according to the 77th round of the National Statistical Organisation’s Situation Assessment of Agricultural Household and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India – show that only 13% of the area is leased, it is common knowledge that the actual incidence of leasing is much higher. The chapter also discusses some other findings of the survey including the trend of declining share of farmers’ income from cultivation of crops. An average farmer now earns more from wage, salary, and income from animal husbandry and dairying. The most disputed of the three farm laws was the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020. The author has been following the marketing laws of agricultural produce for decades. Very few people have a deeper understanding of laws enacted by the state governments for regulating the wholesale trade of produce, which is the first point of sale of farmers’ produce. The history of reform of agricultural marketing in the states is discussed in detail. The Union government had circulated a model act in 2003. It was titled ‘State Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2003’. The Union government has been trying to persuade the states to adopt the provisions of the model Act in their own APMC Acts. The model Act sought to regulate not only the marketing of produce but also contract farming operations. It is obvious that encouragement provided to contract farming is not a new idea. Also read: Centre’s Agricultural Marketing Reforms Are an Assault on Federalism The provisions in the model Act of 2003 were analysed in detail in a study published in 2006 by Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS), Jaipur. One of the recommendations of CUTS quoted in the book relates to freeing up agricultural marketing by allowing private markets to compete with APMCs and giving freedom to farmers to sell their produce to anybody and at any place. This is what the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 sought to achieve and failed. The amendments approved by state legislatures of opposition-ruled states, including Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chhatisgarh, have been discussed in the book. The shortcomings of these amendments make it an interesting read. In any case, the governors did not give their consent to the state amendments. The progress of the e-National Agriculture Market started in 2015 is also discussed in the book. In recent months, concerted efforts have been made to make it mainstream for inter-state trade, but there are several gaps in the regulatory regime. However, these have not been discussed in the book. Contract farming The most enriching chapter of the book is on legislation to promote and regulate contract farming. The author has studied this subject for years and highlights that despite regulatory weaknesses, contract farming is practiced in several parts of India for various crops. A table giving the crops and the contracts signed between corporates and farmers is enlightening. However, the author argues strongly against linking the minimum support price (MSP) to the contracted price. Similarly, linking the contracted price to prices in APMCs goes against the very idea of a contract. This chapter must be read by those who think that contract farming is the solution to India’s agriculture and rue the repeal of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. The readers of this review will easily appreciate the difficulty of entering a contract with a much more powerful entity. Those buying flats or houses from builders know what exactly the import of a contract between unequal parties is. And farmers are much weaker vis-a-vis corporate than buyers of flats in relation to the builders. The chapter on the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides the arguments advanced in the 2018 working paper of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), which may have persuaded the government that the two laws relating to APMCs and contract farming will be within the constitutional scheme of distribution of powers between the Centre and the states. The defence of the farm laws by Ramesh Chand, a member of Niti Ayog, is also discussed in this chapter. There is no discussion in the book about the law which has been regularly used by the Union and state governments since the promulgation of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, on June 5, 2020. The Ordinance, and the Amendment Act later, provided that the Union government may regulate the supply of certain food items, including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils, under extraordinary circumstances only. Thus, the EC Act was to be used in case of famine, war, grave natural calamities, and high inflation leading to price rise. The amendments provided that the Union government could impose stock limits only if there is a 100% increase in the retail price of horticultural produce and a 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable agricultural food items. The increase was to be calculated over the retail prices prevailing in the previous 12 months, or the average retail price in the last five years, whichever was lower. If this amendment of the EC Act was not repealed, the government would not have been able to use it as an important instrument for controlling inflation. So, the stock limit on wheat, rice, pulses, or onions would not have been possible in most cases as the conditions of the amendment were not met. The chapter on MSP highlights the difficulties in making it a legal right. The APMC Act of Madhya Pradesh has a provision since 1986 that farmers’ produce will not be bought below MSP declared by the state government. But the state has never declared its own MSP for any crop! So, the provision remains on paper. India is a large and agriculturally diverse nation. That is why the framers of the constitution made agriculture a state subject. The APMC laws of each state deserve detailed examination and analysis. This slim volume highlights the need for such a project. One can only hope that academic and research institutions will be provided funding by state governments and the Union ministry of agriculture for such studies. I also hope that agriculture ministers and secretaries of the states can find time to read this important book on burning issues of farm policy.

https://thewire.in/environment/uttarkashi-camera-first-visuals-of-trapped-tunnel-workers,Environment,Uttarakhand Tunnel Collapse: Camera Relays First Visuals of Trapped Workers,"New Delhi: An endoscopic camera relayed the first visuals of the 41 workers trapped in an under-construction tunnel in Uttarakhand on Tuesday (November 21) morning. Footage of the workers provided by Uttarakhand’s information department shows them gathered in front of the camera and responding to instructions given by rescue personnel through a loudspeaker. “If everyone is fine, show yourselves in front of the camera. Raise your hand and smile, we will reach you soon. Don’t worry,” a rescuer is heard saying in Hindi in the video. #UttarakhandTunnelCollapse | First visuals of workers trapped in Uttarkashi tunnel emerge Read more: https://t.co/qBAxCOLm6M (Credits: Uttarakhand Information Department) pic.twitter.com/0FoWZI8x9q — The Indian Express (@IndianExpress) November 21, 2023  Another rescuer was heard counting and trying to identify workers visible on camera. One worker was also seen holding a walkie-talkie. The endoscopic camera reached the workers through a six-inch wide pipe, media reports said. A press release by the Union roads ministry said that the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) drilled the pipe through debris separating the workers from one of the tunnel’s entrances on Monday. On the same day, the pipe was being prepared to give the workers their first hot meal – khichdi packed in bottles – since they were trapped there nine days ago on November 12, news agency ANI reported. They were receiving dry food and medicines through a four-inch wide pipe until then. The tunnel is intended to run between Uttarakhand’s Barkot and Silkyara towns. Part of it reportedly collapsed on November 12 due to a nearby landslide, and the resulting debris trapped the workers close to the tunnel’s Silkyara end. Roughly 50 to 60 workers had been on the overnight shift at the time of the collapse; those closest to the tunnel’s exit were able to make it out in time while the others could not. Rescuers initially used an auger machine to horizontally drill through the debris from the Silkyara end, but had to halt operations on Friday (November 17) after the NHIDCL reported a loud cracking noise during the drilling. Reuters reported the NHIDCL’s statement as saying that the auger machine was also experiencing difficulties and that its bearings were suffering damage. The roads ministry said on Monday that the horizontal drilling was set to resume that evening, but as of Tuesday afternoon it is unclear if this has happened. Soon after drilling work was suspended, authorities devised a five-pronged plan to rescue the workers, which involves drilling vertically from the top of the hill the tunnel goes through, as well as ‘micro-drilling’ through the tunnel’s left side. Horizontal drilling from the tunnel’s Barkot end has also commenced, the roads ministry said on Monday. Advisory to TV channels The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued an advisory to TV channels that are covering the rescue mission, saying that the telecast of video footage and other pictures by placing cameras and other equipment in close proximity to the site “have the potential to adversely affect the ongoing
operations”. The ministry asked the channels to refrain from sensationalising the issue and broadcasting any live videos from close proximity of the tunnel site. It said the media should ensure that the activities of the various agencies are in no way disrupted or disturbed by the very presence of cameramen, reporters or equipment near or around the operations site. “It is also advised to be cautious and sensitive while reporting on the matter especially in putting out headlines, videos & images and take due care of the sensitive nature of operation, psychological status of the family members and as well as the viewers in general,” the advisory said. Foreign experts drafted Foreign experts have been drafted in for the rescue operation, including independent disaster investigator Arnold Dix, who is president of the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association. #WATCH | Uttarkashi (Uttarakhand) tunnel rescue operation | International Tunneling Expert, Arnold Dix says, “It’s fantastic, of course, the news we have had over the last few hours.

He continued: “But it has its technical difficulties, and that’s why we’re doing multiple rescue missions – we’ve got missions from the top, missions from the front, [a] mission from the side.” According to ANI, rescue work was delayed on Tuesday when a piling machine being transported to the tunnel became stuck due to the road it was travelling on being too narrow. The Times of India reported one of the trapped workers as telling a government official that “we are getting food, but all of us are in bad condition … it is getting harder and harder with each passing day.” The BBC said that at least three of the workers reported having dysentery and authorities were providing them with medicines. The workers were working on part of a new national highway, the Char Dham all-weather road, a flagship federal project by the Union government that aims to reduce travel times between four ancient Hindu pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand state. It would also improve access to strategic areas of the country near the border with regional rival China. With inputs from DW.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/economy/the-logic-and-compassion-behind-the-rajasthan-governments-many-schemes,Economy,The Logic and Compassion Behind the Rajasthan Government's Many Schemes,"Over the last couple of years, the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan has passed a slew of progressive welfare policies. With the assembly elections in the state due later this month, the opposition has accused the state government of using welfare policies merely as a means to remain in power. On the other hand, some economists, particularly those working with the NDA government at the Union government, have raised questions about the need and importance of such policies. However, such concerns appear to be misplaced. Illustration: Pariplab Chakraborty In July, the Rajasthan government passed the Minimum Guaranteed Income Act (MGIA), which guarantees all families in rural and urban areas 125 days of work in a year. The act combines Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (a central government Act) with a State Act, the Indira Gandhi Urban Employment Scheme (IGUES), launched last year. While MGNREGA targets rural households, IGUES is for urban residents. With the IGUES, Rajasthan became only the sixth state in the country to have an urban employment guarantee scheme.  However, what differentiates Rajasthan is that the scheme is a legal guarantee in Rajasthan, unlike other states. Economists, for long, have been urging the central government for the same as ecological degradation, mediocre infrastructure, relatively thinner social safety net, high unemployment rates, and poor quality low wage jobs in urban areas make it a necessity.  MGIA also guarantees a pension of Rs 1,000 to the elderly, disabled, widows, and divorced women, which will be increased by 15% every year. This amount is double the previous pension amount of Rs 500 and covers almost 1 crore beneficiaries, i.e., nearly one in every eight people in the state. This increase takes the state share of pension expenditure in Rajasthan to 97%, with the central government contributing Rs 367 crores for its measly Rs 200 national pension – an amount that hasn’t increased since 2006 despite repeated advice by economists and other experts.  Elsewhere, the Rajasthan government launched the Chief Minister Folk Artist Promotion Scheme on 11th August, which guarantees 100 days of employment at government events to all folk artists in the state and a one-time transfer of Rs 5,000 to buy music equipment. This initiative will work wonders in preserving or even reviving the shrinking world of Rajasthani folk art and uplifting historically neglected nomadic tribes like Kalbeliyas, Langas, and Manganiyars, which form the bulk of the folk artists in the state. As per estimates based on NSSO surveys by Brookings India, nearly 7% of the country’s population is pushed into poverty every year due to unbearable healthcare costs. The Infant Mortality Rate in Rajasthan, according to the latest Sample Registration System data, is 32 per thousand live births, whereas the Maternal Mortality Rate stands at 113 per 100,000 live births – both significantly higher than the national average. Alarmingly, anaemia also witnessed a  rise in Rajasthan between the 4th (2015-16) and the 5th (2019-20) rounds of the National Family Health Survey. For children up to five years of age, anaemia rose from 60.3% to 71.5%.  Moreover, according to NITI Aayog’s latest health index, which is a composite score of overall health performance based on 24 indicators, Rajasthan ranked 16th among 19 large states. In this light, Rajasthan’s Right to Health Care Act, passed in March this year, which guarantees free emergency treatment to everyone, is historic. However, it must be noted that the bill’s final version was diluted by weakening grievance redressal mechanisms and eliminating civil society participation in the oversight committee due to incessant lobbying by primarily private doctor bodies. Over 90% of private hospitals in the state will now not be under the bill’s ambit, leaving only 47 private hospitals across the state eligible for the Act. Additionally, the government also increased its universal insurance coverage under Chiranjeevi Scheme from Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 25 lakhs. Since the scheme’s inception in 2021, over 1.35 crore families have enrolled, and more than 15 lakh people have already availed of its benefits.  Women building a pond as part of MGNREGA work. Representational image. Photo: UN Women/Gaganjit Singh Earlier this year, the Gehlot government also passed the Indira Gandhi gas subsidy scheme, which provides LPG cylinders to over 76 Lakh poorest households at a flat rate of Rs 500, resulting in a subsidy of Rs 450 at current prices. To understand the scheme’s importance, consider this: in 2021-22, out of about 9.6 crore Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries, 10% took no refill, 11% took only one while 57% took 4 or fewer refills according to government data whereas non-PMUY consumers refilled their cylinders 7 times on average in the year. The reason behind this is the skyrocketing price of LPG, which went from Rs 574 in August 2019 to Rs 949 in March’22 in Delhi. Furthermore, prices of necessities such as pulses, oils, sugar, and spices have also increased rapidly in the past few years. Hence, the Annapurna scheme, launched earlier this year, which provides one kg of dal, sugar, salt, edible oil, and spices for free to families covered by the National Food Security Act (NFSA), was a major relief. The inclusion of oils and pulses in PDS entitlements had been a long-standing demand of food security activists and economists alike to help meet the nutritional needs of the people. Furthermore, in 2020, the Gehlot government launched Indira Rasois to ensure that no person has to sleep hungry. Indira rasois are community kitchens that provide a warm, nutritious meal at just ₹8 per thali. To date, 1000 urban kitchens have served more than 15 crore meals, according to the government, with 1000 additional kitchens in rural areas opening soon in the state. With the gas subsidy, Indira Rasois, and the Annapurna scheme, Rajasthan has perhaps taken the boldest steps in the country to reduce hunger and provide relief from inflation. On July 24, Rajasthan became the first state in the country to pass a social security act for its over 3 lakh gig workers. The Act will establish a welfare board for gig workers where registered gig workers will have the opportunity to be heard for grievances and participate in decision-making in addition to being eligible for general and specific social security schemes. Over the past few years, issues such as long working hours, meagre pay, lack of insurance and social security have led to strikes by thousands of workers from all major platforms. While the bill is a welcome first step, it should be noted that it leaves much to be desired. Most notably, the act does not address the informal nature of gig work – perhaps the root of most gig workers’ grievances. Moreover, the act does not define what it means by social security, thus leaving details of actual benefits and implementation shrouded in ambiguity. Over the last two years, Rajasthan has enacted an impressive set of progressive policies for which it deserves credit. However, it is essential to note that the actual success lies in the implementation of these schemes, which remains to be seen. While the intent is laudable, it wouldn’t amount to much if the implementation is lacklustre. The Gehlot administration, elsewhere, has also been accused of using welfare only as a means to remain in power in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. Regardless of Gehlot’s political intentions, it should be noted that responding to public demand and needs is supposed to be a fundamental tenet of any democratic society. Thus, if anything, pressurising governments to respond to people’s needs should be seen as a successful example of democracy in action.  The state government has also attracted criticism for doling out so-called freebies or revdi, as Prime Minister Modi calls it. However, in a country where over 70 crore people depend on PDS rations to survive, calling welfare schemes ‘freebies’ or ‘revdi’ displays a surprising lack of touch with the socio-economic reality of the masses. Critics of welfare schemes often point out the assumed unsustainable nature of social security expenditure. While it is true that certain fiscal constraints bind governments, critics often weaponise these constraints only to advocate for cuts in social spending. In Rajasthan’s case, however, the fiscal deficit has fallen faster than the average of other states since 2020-21. It fell by 2.2% of GSDP between 2020-21 and 2023-24 in Rajasthan, whereas it fell by less than 1% of GSDP for other states on average. Moreover, the state’s tax revenue is estimated to increase from 6.6% of GSDP in 2022-23 to 7.2% of GSDP this year. The state seems to be doing well both in terms of expected tax revenue and fiscal deficit. Many economists believe that a demand-side push through welfare policies that increase the disposable income of low-income households is a proven method of reviving demand in the economy. Simply put, welfare expenditure allows families to save more money which could then, in turn, be used to demand other goods and services, thus increasing aggregate demand in the economy.  Therefore, critics’ concerns appear to be founded less in facts and more in prejudice towards welfare. Opposing ‘freebies’ while giving out corporate subsidies worth lakhs of crores is not only bad policymaking but also obstructs people from exercising their right to live with human dignity, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

The dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against major currencies, dropped to 103.57 from 104.16 on Friday. The weakening of the dollar was attributed to market expectations that US interest rates may have peaked, with a focus on signs of the US Federal Reserve potentially easing monetary conditions, Business Standard reported.

The latest payroll data released by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) on Monday, November 20, revealed a 6.45% decrease in the number of new monthly subscribers under the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF). The number of new subscribers dropped from 953,092 in August to 891,583 in September. While the net payroll additions – calculated using new subscribers, exits, and the return of old subscribers – rose by 14.9% to 1.72 million in September, these numbers are provisional and are usually subject to significant revisions in the following month. According to Business Standard, the proportion of women among the fresh EPF subscribers in September declined from 26.12% in August to 25.3% (226,392). On the other hand, the share of individuals in the 18-28 age group increased slightly from 67.93% in August to 68.8% in September. The newspaper reported that this age group is a crucial metric as these individuals are “usually first-timers in the labour market, thus reflecting its robustness”. The labour ministry said in a statement that around 41.46% of the net membership addition in September came from expert services, including manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, and miscellaneous activities. “A month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays significant growth in the members working in establishments engaged in the sugar industry, courier services, iron and steel, hospitals, travel agencies, etc,” it said. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), however, reported positive trends in the labour markets for September. The unemployment rate dropped to a one-year low, decreasing from 8.10% in August to 7.09% in September. Notably, rural unemployment fell to 6.20% from 7.11% in August, while urban unemployment decreased from 10.09% to 8.94% during the same period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It examines the solutions the state is offering to ask what their true meaning is for people and the climate. In this series, a three-part investigation focuses on the policy of rice fortification in India’s public-sector food programmes. Does such a policy really help those with anaemia and malnutrition? Who benefits from it instead? Monocropping rice and wheat after the Green Revolution and cereal-heavy diets have depleted soils and worsened nutrition. Then, what does it mean to seek the solution in artificially fortifying cereals with factory-made micronutrients? These stories uncover the policy’s impact on the ground.

Along with rice, Gope and other farmers here grow numerous vegetables such as bhindi (okra), barwati(string bean), sem phali(field bean), kundri(gourds), pitha (pumpkins) on thousands of small farms.   In the sowing season last year, Jharkhand received the lowest rainfall in 121 years. This year, as the skies remained hot and clear even till the month of August, erratic monsoon rains have delayed paddy sowing. The Singhbhum region’s farmers hold a rich but diminishing resource. They have a history of cultivating hundreds of indigenous varieties of paddy, names which linger in memory and conversations: Chandra Kanthi, Lolaat, Joradhaan, Maanjhi, and so on. Scientists at the Birsa Agricultural University’s district campus, on the highway connecting Jamshedpur city to Gope’s village Panajea, say that over the years the soil has turned more acidic. Many farmers now rely on hybrid seeds varieties, such as “MDU1010”, “IR64” and “PH76”, and use fertilisers to grow paddy. Singhbhum’s farmers grow hundreds of nutritious folk varieties of rice, but over the years, they have switched to cultivating other varieties. Photo: Anumeha Yadav. As part of the Modi government’s new strategy to combat anaemia and malnutrition, two years ago, in October 2021, it began supplying new kind of rice, chemically fortified with iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid, to the poor here, including small farmers such as Kamal Kant Gope in Jharkhand’s Panajea village. Industrial processing, and abrasive polishing to increase the “whiteness” of rice strips the grain of its bran layer, a dietary fibre rich in minerals and other nutrients. As rice grains get stripped of nutrients, some development experts advocate re-introducing nutrients into rice, by fortifying it with a micronutrient premix.Under the policy called “large scale fortification”, micro-nutrients are artificially added to staples, such as rice. How it is being done in rice is this – a dried powder “pre-mix” of vitamins and minerals – iron, vitamin B12, folic acid – is added into broken rice, or powdered rice grains. The paste, containing factory-made nutrients, is passed through pasta-extrusion equipment to manufacture new grains, with a slightly artificial appearance compared to natural rice. The new grains are mixed into regular rice supplied to the poor monthly in gunny bags as a food subsidy under the National Food Security Act. Dalbhumgarh and Chakulia blocks were among the sites in a national pilot study for this mandatory rice fortification scheme, chosen because most of Jharkhand’s rice mills are located here, and also because of the history and trend of paddy production here. It has now been many months since Gope, who lives in Dalbhumgarh, first held a new opaque rice grain made in an industrial unit in his palm, instead of translucent grains that ripen every year in the emerald stalks in his fields. He remained sceptical of what the government was providing as “food”. “If the government pressures us to eat it saying it is “Vitamin Rice”, at least it ought to have some taste or the qualities of rice?” Gope asked. He explained with some exasperation, “This is not rice. If I hold it tight in my fist, it falls away like a grain of sand, it does not stick like rice. Even its maarh (the water left after rice is cooked) is of very thin consistency. Then how can it be nutritious?” The fortified rice made using extrusion machine in a factory have an artificial appearance compared to natural rice. Gope said that those who cultivate rice such as him know what “good food” is. “In our village, we have eaten dheki ka chaawal, we know how to pound and mill paddy into rice ourselves at home, in small batches. The maarh [starch] of that rice is so thick, it contains nutrients from nature.” “Locally, we have paddy varieties such as Makarkanthi, Kaankri, and Nohaachi-dhaan,” he continued. “Nohaachi-dhaan with thick bran is red, almost black, in colour with grains filled with nutrients. The maarh is delicious – thicker than milk with Horlicks! Yet, the local rice is light and easy to digest.” Gope who is the traditional headman of his village Panajea, was not only unconvinced by the government policy on rice fortification – he was also alarmed and anxious. He believed that the new fortified grains may not be suitable for those who are not well. “I believe, not everyone will be able to digest this new rice.” “In fact, since this rice started being distributed, we have had two instances where people who fell ill needed blood transfusions,” he said. “If this rice has additional vitamins, then why is that happening? How do we know if it is even helping?” At risk and uncertain Inside Panajea village, this reporter met one of the individuals whose health Gope was concerned about. Rahul Gope, a quiet teenager dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, had a slight build, which made him appear smaller than his age. His face was pale and his eyes had turned yellow. Rahul’s mother, Chherani Gope shared multiple laboratory reports that showed how Rahul had undergone two blood transfusions in the previous three weeks for the first time in his life this summer. At the time of the first blood transfusion, laboratory reports showed, he had a blood haemoglobin level – an essential protein carrying oxygen in the body – of merely 5.9. This was not even half of the healthy norm for his age. He was severely anaemic.  The reports also showed excess bilirubin, more than three times the normal, showing an excess in his body of a pigment formed from a breakdown of blood cells. Rahul’s mother Chherani Gope shared medical reports that showed no clear diagnosis of his severe anaemia, accompanied with jaundice. Photos: Anumeha Yadav. The family said they had spent more than Rs 20,000 on multiple visits to the nearest health facility and laboratory, 40 km away in Jhargram in Bengal (the neighbouring state), but they did not have a diagnosis for Rahul’s condition. They live more than 100 km away from Jamshedpur city, where tertiary health facilities are located. The government’s mandatory rice fortification in public schemes is a response to chronically high levels of anaemia in the Indian population, which manifests, among other forms, in low haemoglobin levels such as Rahul’s. But at the same time, the government acknowledges that it could potentially harm those like him, whose low haemoglobin could be a result of other conditions such as inherited blood disorders prevalent in this region’s Adivasi residents. One of these is sickle cell disease, a blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation. In it, an individual’s blood cells are misshapen, like sickles or crescents. Such misshapen cells can get stuck in blood vessels, causing organ damage, debilitating pain, and strokes. In India, it largely affects Adivasi communities. Thalassemia is another inherited blood disorder caused by damaged or missing genes in which the body does not make adequate haemoglobin. It is managed with regular blood transfusions.  In sickle cell anaemia, an individual’s misshapen blood cells look like sickles, and can block the major blood vessels. In fact, each gunny bag containing fortified rice in the public distribution system carries a warning in small print in English – a language neither understood nor spoken by the vast majority of India’s rural poor – that the fortified rice is not meant for those with conditions such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. This is because the effect of additional iron stores from iron fortified food is not clear or known on such individuals’ bodies. If the excess iron gets stored, it may potentially damage their organs, say experts. The symptoms Rahul was suffering from – very low haemoglobin combined with jaundice – has been seen in those with sickle cell disease. But that afternoon, Rahul had neither any information nor access to tests to determine whether he was among those who ought to avoid eating the iron fortified rice. Nor was any alternate food provided to him in the public system. ‘Diktat’ to feed fortified rice Officials in the state capital Ranchi, 180 km away, who run the scheme to distribute ration rice, said they lack information on how many of existing food rations card holders in Jharkhand already suffer from such “hemoglobinopathies”, disorders such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, and are thus supposed to avoid eating the iron-fortified rice. Nor did the department have provisions to give them an alternative to the chemically fortified rice, which would mean continuing to provide them custom milled rice as it did earlier. “The only positive thing is that since the distribution of iron-fortified rice began, we have not got an adverse health report from the field yet,” a senior official in the Jharkhand government, overseeing the new policy’s implementation, stated about his discomfort with the scheme. He added that when several critics, including the state’s former minister for food and civil supplies Sarayu Roy, publicly opposed the scheme, to improve public understanding, the department had organised workshops, inviting medical experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), organisations who work on sickle cell anaemia and civil society groups. .@narendramodi राशन एवं मध्याह्न भोजन में फ़ोर्टिफ़ाइड चावल वितरित करने की केन्द्र सरकार की योजना पर पुनर्विचार करें.यह मानव स्वास्थ्य के लिये हानिकारक है.यह प्राकृतिक नहीं बल्कि औद्योगिक चावल है.सरकार इस योजना के पायलट प्रोजेक्ट के आँकड़े सार्वजनिक करे,तुलनात्मक फ़ायदा बताए. — Saryu Roy (@roysaryu) April 9, 2022 
The official said that the Jharkhand state government, which looks after the health and nutrition needs of some of the poorest communities of India, was provided no choice by the Union government in implementing this new policy, even when Jharkhand lacks adequate infrastructure, such as laboratories which can test the added micronutrient content, to ensure quality control and safety. “The situation came to this: the Food Corporation of India, which supplies us the rice which we distribute to the poor, said that if you do not take chemically fortified rice, you will not get any rice. Then the public grain distribution in Jharkhand would stop,” said the official. In Jharkhand, so far, the Food Corporation of India (FCI), under the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, acted as an aggregator. Under the National Food Security Act, it procured paddy and provided it to Jharkhand from a central pool. After the paddy is milled, it is transported to FCI warehouses, and then the state-level bodies distribute it further at retail outlets. “The food ministry told us: ‘If you wish to distribute simple “custom made rice” (CMR) like before, then make your own arrangements for that.’ The Jharkhand state government does not have the wherewithal to do so, without FCI’s support,” the official stated. “State government ko unhone majboor kiya ki aap ko fortified lena hi hai, doosra koi option nahi. (They made it compulsory for us, giving us no option but to distribute fortified food.)”  ‘Mandatory’ scheme? In 2021, the Union government selected a district each in 15 states to distribute fortified rice as a pilot scheme. It started distributing fortified rice in the government’s food safety programmes in 2022. It plans to expand this scheme to all districts of India by March 2024 with a yearly budget of nearly Rs 3,000 crore, or $350 million approximately. From March 2022, it made fortified rice compulsory in the children’s schemes. From March 2023 onwards, it introduced it in ration, or the public distribution scheme.  India’s ration scheme is the largest food safety scheme in the world, reaching 80 crore or 800 million individuals. For a comparison, the World Food Programme(WFP) reached 160 million people in 2022. After years of advocacy by grassroots activists’ networks such as the Right to Food Campaign, the previous government expanded food security schemes to include 67% of India’s population. Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, every member of a poor household receives five kg of grains, wheat or rice, at very low costs at village ration shops. The poorest households get 35 kg grains each month. Under the midday meal programme, 115 million school children get a hot cooked meal daily, and under the Integrated Child Development Scheme(ICDS), the world’s largest early childcare program, 158 million infants, pregnant and lactating women, get supplementary nutrition at community creches. In the ICDS and school lunch schemes, the government supplies around 3.5 million(35 lakh) metric tonnes of iron-fortified rice. This increases ten-fold to more than 35 million (350 lakh) metric tonnes fortified rice in the public distribution scheme, when scaled to all districts by 2024. In October this year, the government distributed nearly 17,74,153 metric tonnes of fortified rice in its welfare schemes.  India has the second highest sickle cell disease burden incidence in the world, and the largest number of children with thalassemia-major in the world. The government has provided a few numbers in parliament.  On August 9, 2021, responding to a parliament question, Minister of State for tribal affairs Renuka Singh Saruta replied that 1,13,83,664 (1.13 crore or 11.3 million) persons in India were screened for sickle cell disease and “8.75% (9,96,368, or 9 million) tested positive (trait in 949057, disease 47,311).” Further, the minister stated that “studies undertaken by Indian Council of Medical Research show prevalence of sickle cell anaemia across the country is 5-34% (as per document on sickle cell anaemia control programme published by Government of Gujarat)”. On a question about thalassemia, on March 20, 2020, the government replied that in India, “an estimated 10,000-12,000 children with B (the beta)-Thalassemia are born every year”. In pilots conducted for launching the intervention, the government tested how the supply chain of fortified rice works – or how it would reach from the manufacturing unit to a rice mill, to government godowns to retail rations shops. It did not study the impact of the intervention on public health, or on anaemia, or how the individuals with certain health conditions would tolerate this rice.   Activists pointed out that despite significant populations being at risk, the government launched the scheme without safeguarding how individuals with such blood disorders would be affected when they ate the fortified food, or how their bodies would react to the additional synthetic iron in food. Not only activists, but even members of the government’s scientific panels have publicly spoken against giving such rice to those suffering from sickle cell disease and thalassemia patients.  Such iron-fortified food should also not be given to those with other conditions such as severe malnutrition, and newly diagnosed tuberculosis, said Dr Sylvia Karpagam, a doctor and public health researcher, who works on right to health and nutrition among marginalised communities. “Malnutrition and tuberculosis can often remain undiagnosed and untreated in India. Then, why are policymakers surging ahead with iron fortification of rice on such a large and irreversible scale?” asked Dr Karpagam. “Is it because these conditions affect the poor more than the elite? Each gunny bag of fortified rice in the ration system carries a health warning in small print in English, a language neither understood nor spoken by the majority of poor. Photo: Anumeha Yadav. Balram, of the Right to Food Campaign was one of the first to study the implementation of the fortified rice scheme in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.  “We tracked it in four villages in two pilot blocks. Printing a health warning in small print in English in rural areas is totally ineffective. And anyway, the rice is distributed to the poor as loose grains, not in bags,” he said. “Despite the formal warning, we found grassroots health workers had no instructions to make this distinction for the affected individuals in the villages. It shows the government’s utter lack of concern. There are no real safeguards to enforce it. Yet, the scheme has been scaled up, like a royal diktat disregarding the palate, food habits, taste of millions.”  Activist Rajesh Krishnan, who was part of the campaign, filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court last December over the impact on health of such vulnerable groups. Hearing the case last month, the court asked the government to respond in November. Among the evidence the Union government considered in the scheme’s favour was a randomised control trial (a study in which two groups – one which receives an intervention and the other which doesn’t – are compared) on the impact of fortified rice on reducing anaemia conducted by the Tata Trusts, which is a philanthropic initiative of the Indian multinational Tata Sons. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has funded Tata Trusts to advocate for and work on fortification in India. For instance, it gave Sir Dorabji Tata Trusts US $ 3 million for “Food Fortification MIYCN (maternal and child nutrition) Joint Programming Platform” in 2016. Food and health activists have criticised relying on such sources which were conducting “friendly research” financed by lobbying groups as a potential conflict of interest. Tata is a conglomerate which owns several businesses, including in chemicals, food and in nutraceutical sectors. Moreover, even this promotional study conducted by Tata Trusts in Gadchiroli district, one of the poorest parts of Maharashtra in western India, which is a glowing evaluation of such an intervention, was cautious on providing the rice to those with sickle cell disease. The Tata Trusts study recorded a “loss of sample”. It had to exclude a sizeable number of individuals from the study sample because it found they “suffered from sickle cell disease”. Ministries’ correspondence first accessed by The Reporters’ Collective notes that in blood tests, “7.4% mothers at Kurkheda, 17.1% at Bhamragarh”, “15% adolescent girls at Kurkheda, 10.3% at Bhamragarh” and among children, “9.5% at Kurkheda, 8.2% at Bhamragarh” were found to “have sickle cell disease”. The evaluators avoided feeding iron-fortified rice to these women, adolescents and children who suffered from the blood disorder resulting from a flawed haemoglobin mechanism in their bodies. The Tata Trusts study recorded that they could not study those with sickle cell anaemia. The government had ignored that even such studies, financed by entities such as Tata, had avoided giving this rice to vulnerable groups. “In all studies, certain groups are excluded and we don’t fully know or understand the impact on them,” explained a doctor working in the government, who declined to be named. “We have no way to know the full impact on such groups.” Medical experts explained one of the less understood concerns, firstly, how excess iron may get stored in a form that was of no use to the body, and secondly, it could do harm. “Studies show some such patients will not be able to down-regulate their iron absorption, and will continue to absorb iron. The problem with excess iron is that it ends up in a toxic form in the blood,” explained Dr Anura Kurpad, a professor at St John’s Medical College, Bengaluru, who chaired the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) expert committee on nutrient requirements, and was a member of the scientific committee of the food regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.  “This excess iron that is unbound to the usual transport protein called transferrin is (quite unimaginatively) called “non transferrin bound iron” or NTBI. This is particularly toxic as it forms reactive oxidative species that cause a lot of damage to cells.” Dr Kurpad said this could lead to “cardiac damage, liver fibrosis, gonadal dysfunction, and growth retardation, among many others” for such individuals. Dr Kurpad further said that the storage form of iron – ferritin – would also increase, with increased rick of chronic diseases like diabetes. In the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Dr Kurpad showed this was linked to increased risks among adolescents of non-communicable disease. “There must be a mechanism for the problem of balancing the risks and benefits of iron supplementation in these areas – there is no shortcut,” he told The Wire. After criticism by activists and academics, the food safety regulator, FSSAI in August 2021 issued a gazette adding “persons with Sickle Cell Anemia” in the language of its fortification regulations of 2018, advising them not to consume “iron fortified products”. Taking no responsibility to ensure this, it left it to already overburdened health departments in states to identify and protect such persons. In mid-2021, the Union government set up a Sickle Cell Disease Support Corner in collaboration with the Piramal Foundation’s Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute to “create a database of individuals with sickle cell disease, or traits in the tribal population”. Under this, it is carrying out a “universal screening of 7 crore people in the age group of 0-40 years in affected tribal areas”. Piramal Foundation is the philanthropy arm of US $ 4 billion-worth Piramal Group of Companies. The Swiss pharmaceutical, Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., which was then the world’s largest multinational company making synthetic vitamins had sold its India business’ majority stakes to Piramal. Piramal Group includes a nutraceutical business manufacturing synthetic vitamins and minerals, and is among the suppliers of factory-made nutrients in the government fortification programme.  Public health experts expressed wariness at the involvement of nutraceutical-funded entities which advocated for the mandatory fortification of staples, and they questioned the ethics of such a mass screening of millions. “Such mass, universal screening for sickle cell anaemia raises ethical concerns because youth diagnosed with it may face discrimination in jobs, marriage and so on,” said Dr Yogesh Jain, a community physician who has treated sickle cell disease patients in rural Adivasi areas in north Chhattisgarh. “It may be good to ensure complete diagnosis to those who are symptomatic, and once achieved, screen pregnant women, or newborns. Once that is done, you may consider mass screening after consulting with all communities and be ethically correct.”  Dr Jain added that he did not view mandatory iron fortification of rice as a cure for India’s anaemic population, because nutritional deficiency is the cause of 60% of all anaemia and iron deficiency is the cause of two-thirds of nutrition deficiency. Thus, iron deficiency anaemia constitutes the cause in less than half of all anaemia cases, the other causes being inflammation, or infections. “Large scale food fortification is a rent-seeking approach shrouded as a technological fix, where companies profit from making and blending nutrients. How will it help?” said Dr Jain. “I believe fortified rice in this form does not even adequately help the iron-deficient. It is corroborated by studies that food-based corrections, such as providing iron in the diet along with a fruit, would be better.” Public health experts say access to eating fresh, diverse foods such as citrus fruits will help an individual in better absorbing iron from food sources.

The Union government appointed PATH as a “development partner” in Jharkhand to help implement the scheme.  PATH is a “product development organisation” initiated by Ford Foundation in 1977, which is heavily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with which it has long standing institutional ties. In 1998, before the official establishment of the Gates Foundation, Gates created the Bill & Melinda Gates Children’s Vaccine Programme with a donation of $100 million and this was administered by PATH’s secretariat in Seattle. As per its 2022 financial report, 43% of its funding was from one private foundation, and 32% from United States government agencies. In 2021, this was 48% and 23% respectively. In 2010, the Indian government had halted a trial by PATH (funded by the Gates Foundation) among Adivasi children, in which it was testing vaccines against cervical cancer. A 2013 report by the parliamentary standing committee on health found collusion between Indian health regulators and PATH to downplay the violations in this vaccine trial. It found that PATH had described the project as an “observational study” and circumvented rules around such trials, such as reporting of serious adverse effects within a specific time. The parliamentary enquiry found that PATH had violated children’s rights. It had collected data on a large population of 23,500 children of age 10 to 14. In the case of 5,000 children, the parents/guardians were not literate and could not even sign in their local language, in Telugu or Gujarati, and in Andhra, had simply obtained the consent from hostel wardens of residential schools the Adivasi children were in.  As per the latest financial documents on the website of the Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute, which is running a “support corner” for sickle cell disease and is tasked with creating a database of individuals with sickle disease or traits in India’s tribal population, in the financial quarter July to September 2023, the Gates Foundation donated to it Rs 18 crore as a grant, and PATH gave it a grant of Rs 1.4 crore.  Activists critiqued the conflict of interest inherent in these policies. “It is a situation where the for-profit entity of the business is first supplying the fortificant earning profits, and the not-for-profit part of the same entity is managing the potential health harms,” said Soumik Banerjee, one of the authors of the RTF and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) fact-finding report on the scheme in Chhattisgarh. Referring to the government’s delayed advisory for those with sickle cell anaemia to avoid eating fortified rice, he called mandatory fortification “a wasteful strategy for the most, while potentially harmful for a few.”  Health and food activists say the scheme will help multinationals earn profits in selling micronutrients, but not address the crisis of undernourishment. Photo: Anumeha Yadav. He added: “Food fortification has been sometimes used as a temporary measure. But in pushing to make it mandatory in India’s public schemes, these foundations and multi-nationals are simply creating new markets, while undermining smallholder farmers and their diets.” Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute and the Piramal Foundation did not respond to an emailed questionnaire from The Wire. A PATH official administering the programme who declined to be identified in the report said the criticism was exaggerated. “The critics are wrong. On one hand, there is evidence that fortified rice will address anaemia, on the other, in India, it is being done such that it would meet only 25% of an individual’s recommended dietary allowance, thus, there is very little scope of toxicity,” adding, “When these critics say that individuals are at risk, if the exact number of those with sickle cell anaemia is not even known, then where are they getting data to ask such questions from? It’s not clear.” The Gates Foundation and PATH did not respond to an emailed questionnaire from The Wire on the advocacy for mandatory fortification, the experimentation and its potential side effects on vulnerable populations, including those with sickle cell anaemia. ‘How can we eat it when the birds don’t?’ Jawahar, a social activist in Palamu, questioned why fortified rice had been mandatory. “If it is harmful for some group of people, such as those with thalassemia or sickle cell disease, why is it being given to anyone at all?” he asked. He said there was little social acceptance of the new grains even months after they had been introduced, and several questions remained. “The people wonder why isn’t “plastic rice” being given in the open market, why only as government ration? Some eat it. But I would say about half do not.”  Most families The Wire interviewed said they separate the fortified grains and feed it to poultry. Photo: Anumeha Yadav He continued, saying that the fortified rice’s artificial appearance made it hard to accept. “You can visually tell the difference between rice and fortified rice. Those it is given to frequently sort and remove the fortified kernels when they prepare their meals. They believe it is plastic rice from China. They ask, if it’s chemical nutrients-based, what will it do inside their stomachs?”  In northern Odisha’s Adivasi villages too, those receiving the fortified rations continued to be sceptical that government was delivering nutrition through fortified rice. A Odiya TV channel’s news reports showing that several rural residents instead believed that ration shop owners were mixing fake grains, or “plastic rice” into the subsidised rice grains, went viral this year receiving ov",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://thewire.in/south-asia/myanmar-junta-airstrikes-mizoram,South Asia,Myanmar Junta's Airstrikes Have Taken 320 Civilian Lives in 9 Months: Report,"New Delhi: As many as 320 civilians and 108 volunteers of the public defence force resisting the Myanmar coup have lost their lives in air strikes carried out by the junta between October 2022 and June 2023, said the report of a study. The report, put together by Burma Affairs and Conflict Study based on publicly accessible information including news reports, said that in the nine month period, as many as 395 air strikes were conducted by the Military Council.  “These airstrikes can be categorised into three types: exclusive jet fighter strikes, exclusive helicopter  attacks,  or a combination of both. Among these, exclusive jet fighter strikes were the most prevalent.  During the 9-months of monitoring,  a minimum of 108 revolutionary volunteers and  at least 320 civilians lost their lives due to these airstrikes,” said the report put out by the non-governmental watch group on its Facebook page this November 21.  The report pointed out that the highest number of such air strikes took place in the Sagaing region, “with the second highest in Karen state and the third highest in the Chin state.” “The helicopter attacks were mainly used in Sagaing, Magway, Karen State, Shah State and Rakhine State,” it added. Most of these regions are located close to the Indian border. This January, residents of Mizoram’s Champai district claimed that five aerial bombs dropped on a rebel camp in the Chin State by the Myanmarese army had landed on the Indian side. Assam Rifles, who were guarding that border, later denied it. Such attacks on the border villages are, however, considered as the cause behind a refugee influx into Mizoram. Early this week, about 5,000 such refugees entered Mizoram’s Champai district due to the air strikes on the Chin State.   The study report said, “The Military Council, in order to justify their airstrikes, claims that they attack only military targets and deny civilian targets, but data shows that one third of all air strikes  do hit civilian targets.” It said, “Among the airstrikes, strikes during combat was the most with 247 times, followed by 64 attacks on villages in the absence of combat. The airstrikes on the positions of the revolutionary forces were the third highest with 43 times, which is a point to be aware of. In addition, it was also seen that air strikes were carried out on civilian targets such as internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps, churches, clinics, workplaces, schools, monasteries and celebratory gatherings.”  The report names eight military airfields from where these strikes have been carried out. While the pro-democracy rebel militias have succeeded in inflicting massive setbacks to the junta on the ground lately, these air strikes by the military have come to them as significant hurdles.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pramila Behera, a social worker in Barpali village in Subdega, questioned why the unnatural looking rice was being given to children in schools and anganwadi. She explained why she found it difficult to believe it was as good to eat as natural food: “It floats separately on water. If you bite it, it makes a “chakat-chakat” sound, as if you are biting into a paste or as clay. None of this happens with ordinary, natural rice.” An electrician and a smallholder farmer in the same village, Jugal Kishor Dansena said he had tried other ways to test the grain’s goodness. “I first noticed a few months back that there is krutim chawal, artificial rice, in the house,” he recounted, as he did repairs in a house backyard. “I separated the strange grains and threw them to the hens. But even the hens did not eat it! It took it in its beak and threw it out.” Sunita Oraon, a farmer in Latehar, Jharkhand in her fields on Karam harvest festival.

Twenty five kilometres from Barpali, in Dirgha village in Dhidikiya in Sundargarh Maximus Kulu, a smallholder rice farmer who owns three acre farmland on which he grows Lohini, an indigenous variety of paddy without using chemical fertilisers, recounted a number of diverse paddy varieties which the farmers grew locally and compared the appearance of fortified rice kernels to – Bhajna, Lusdi, Khandsagar paddy varieties. Kulu, who has three family members, got 20 kilos of rice from the ration shop every month. Since January, he had been receiving fortified rice kernels in food rations, which he separated out. “You can easily spot the differences,” said Kulu. “We sort it out and give it to the hens.”  In East Singhbhum’s Chakulia, which was part of the pilot in Jharkhand, even after a year, women rice farmers said they did not trust the new fortified grains. Phulmani Soren’s family who farm in Digih village on the edge of Chakulia town get 15 kg rice every month as food rations. “We do not eat the new grains, because it is plastic rice.” She said this was even after the local village health worker had told them that the new rice was a kind of “vitamin rice”. “It looks distinct from rice, and it separates from rice when we cook it.” As Phulmani spoke, a few metres away from her, her mother-in-law Gango Soren skinned two pigeons that she was planning to cook for dinner that evening. “We have tested it,” she said. “When we give it to birds, they don’t eat it. Our hen does not eat it, it walks away. Even the pigeons don’t eat it. Then how can it be rice?” she asked, animatedly. “Why is this being given? How can we eat it when even the birds don’t?” *As recorded in the ethnography, “Making place through ritual: Land environment and region among the Santals”," 2018.

https://thewire.in/political-economy/what-explains-the-political-rights-ascendancy-to-global-power,Political Economy,What Explains the Political Right’s Ascendancy to Global Power?,"This is the second part of a two-part review analysis based on the key findings in Oleksandr Svitych’s recent book, The Rise of the Capital-State and Neo-Nationalism, which attempts to provide a political economy approach to the rise of ‘neo-nationalism’ – a populist form of nationalism observed in the contemporary globalised period. Read the first part here. In our own book Strongmen Saviours, our comparative political economy analysis in explaining the recent wave of right-wing populist movements across the world was explained through a distinct pattern exhibiting features that have been unique to the nature of right-wing movements (as against left-wing movements of the past). The purpose then was to provide a comparative socio-political, economic explanation of the rise of populist beliefs and anti-political elite sentiment that has not captured much of the Western and non-Western sphere. The pyramid constructed below, drawn from our book’s research, may offer some insights: Source: Author’s graphic The conceptual pyramid attempts to unpack features of right-wing populism, operating under the guise of ‘ideological populism’ (ideologically aligned populist movements), which has a distinct meaning (see a more detailed explainer here). In simple terms, ideological populism refers to the unchecked and unabated rise of an ideology, the marginalisation of its moderate factions, involving the development of a cult-personality that infuses shades of populism into it. Normatively, this can be ideologically aligned towards the ‘political left’ or the ‘political right’. The distinct characteristics of rightwing populism at least the way we have observed in countries such as India, Turkey, Russia and Brazil did see certain common features, across different times and spaces. I explained a few of these factors/features from the pyramid here. The three contributing drivers for the Right’s authoritative rise to majoritarian power 1. Failure of neoliberalism (supply-side economics of the ’90s) The origins of each of these movements are sourced in the economic discontents of ‘neoliberalism’ or the nature of supply-side economics (externally influenced by the West/Washington Consensus style reform packages) pursued in the 1990s. Studies from scholars like Sides et al. (2018), Norris & Inglehart (2019), and Margalit (2019) also explain this. There is a wave of rise in religious conservatism or religious orthodoxy (from Hindutva to Orthodox Islam to Evangelical Catholicism) that aided the rise of each of the leaders who either belonged to political parties or to orthodox-religious based organisations which ensured an undercurrent of religious conservatism. I explain more about this phenomenon (as seen in India, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil) in a lecture given here. The trigger factor which led to the mass-protest vote in favour of each strongman figure (from Modi to Bolsonaro), was often related to either a series of big public corruption episodes or reported scandal(s) in the home country’s domestic political environment, which gave the opportunity for the mass-support in favour of an alternative imagination of ‘power’ and a leader, someone outside the status quo ruling political elite-to come to power, and enjoy mass popularity. From India to Brazil, each of the countries we discuss in the book saw episodes of public corruption (via scandals) or were operating in a widely ‘perceived environment of corruption’ that made more of the popular vote pivot towards the choice of voting for an ‘alternative’ (as also seen with the protest vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election). The weaponisation of social media in a new tech-enabled information order made it possible for right-wing populists to continue feeding an alternative, post-truth rhetorical narrative (us vs them the axis of immigration) which not only helped them and their parties to constantly gain the support of a polarised ‘majority’ (their own voter base), but also help them sustain/consolidate and then later centralise power at the cost of others (those in minorities). Surveillance capitalism made this possible too under a new nexus of private capital-state relationship which supported ‘strongmen’ figures in power through social media and digitised surveillance tools. 2. Focus on privatisation The nature of fiscal policy and the fiscal choice made by each of the strongmen figures (right-wing populists) in recent years has been drastically varied when compared to the earlier regimes of populist movements (as seen say in Latin America) where strongmen leadership was influenced by a theory of economic and political change belonging to pro-welfare, left-leaning policies (which in some instances like Venezuela made governments fiscally indebted). The latest variant of right-wing populism has seen a promotion of privatisation (a reorientation of previous state-private capital elite relationship) – pursued with gradual disinvestment of public assets, government ownership of resources (including a de-funding of social programmes targeted for areas of job creation, human capital development-healthcare and education). This is widely seen in the fiscal choices made by most strongmen figures (case in point: see Modi’s term of governance in India). Despite this, they (strongmen) continue to strike a chord with extremely low-income voters in some of the lesser developed states/provinces by the deployed political use of specific targeted-beneficiary-based ‘welfare schemes’ (say, free nutrition) to keep the more poor content and as part of a loyal voter base. It must however be observed that none of this so-called ‘welfare’ spending is aimed at the upward mobility of the low-income beneficiary (say through complementary support offered in human capital development – education, healthcare or job support plans). 3. On contestations within: Hyper-globalism and ideological populism Dani Rodrik’s recent work (2021; 2023) offers useful insights on at least addressing one of these ‘contested’ conceptual questions: Why did globalisation of the post-1990s variant fuel a certain wave of populism (one that spread far across the west and the east)? Let’s look at this one first. According to Rodrik, “It is important to understand what are the mechanisms through which globalization fuels populism. Answering this question requires a fully fleshed-out model of political economy. Second, globalization is not just one thing: We can distinguish between international trade, international finance, and international labor flows, specifically. How does each one of these facets of globalization work its way through the political system? Third, globalization is clearly not the only economic shock that creates redistributive effects or economic anxiety—and it may not even be the most important one. Why does globalization appear to have an outsized effect on politics compared to, say, technological change or regular business cycles?” These aspects are studied more empirically by Rodrik in the framework created below:  First, according to Rodrik’s analytical framework above, and most directly, “economic dislocation can determine voters’ preferences for policies and leaders (arrow a). Voters in a region where employment prospects have been adversely affected by a rise in imports may choose to cast their vote for a politician who advocates protectionism and a tougher line against foreign exporters. Second, economic dislocation may shape voters’ preferences indirectly through the effect it has on identity or the salience of certain cultural values (arrow b). Concretely, economic shocks can heighten feelings of insecurity, inducing voters to make sharper distinctions between insiders (“us”) and ethnic, religious, or racial outsiders (“them”). They can lead voters to yearn for an earlier era of prosperity and stability, increasing the political salience of traditional cultural values and hierarchies. And to the extent that they generate wider economic and social gaps within a nation, economic shocks may reinforce more local, less encompassing identities. To the extent that such effects operate, political preferences that appear to be driven by cultural values do in fact have deeper economic roots.” We explored some of these links between the discontents of neoliberal economics and populism in the context of India, Turkey, Brazil and Russia; however, there were other factors complementing this – and to Rodrik’s framework shared above. Two additional causal factors: instances of large-scale public corruption (or an environment of perceived corrupt political elite), and a rise in religious conservatism contributed to the rise of right-wing populist movements that subsequently brought leaders like Modi, Bolsonaro and Putin to power. There is a critical need to put these explanations in both perspective and context while building upon what Gudavarthy’s and Oleksandr’s frame of reasoning brings in light by adopting a more neo-subaltern approach that is grounded in interpreting a random person’s influence/preference for the political right and/or in explaining how the Right operates in influencing one’s everyday ethics – more distinctively and assertively – while thriving on the anxieties, fears and insecurities of the emotive majority, including those fuelled by negative emotions finding an agency of their own by Modi-Shah’s BJP. A lot more needs to be done in also understanding how the moral-ethical core of an average Indian (a Hindu voter subscribing to the populist belief) remains influenced by the applied role of Dharam, Dharma, Kama and Karma in everyday life. A neo-subaltern ethnographic methodology may help explicate some of these new dimensions warranting a mixed-methods approach. Similarly, the conceptualisation of the new capital-state’s oligarghic rise, at least in India, is linked to the nature of change seen in the global technological application of information technology, rise of new media (via social media) that weaponised a counter-narrative for extreme forms of radicalism amongst the masses, interplaying with their discontented feelings about neoliberal economic policies (leaving many of them worse off), the breakdown of the old welfare state (creating an erosion of access to basic amenities), rising corruption, and a moralistic-vacuum created in a ‘material-acquisitioning’ capitalistic landscape (triggering a rise of conservatism, orthodoxy, and desiring a new moral-ethical code for everyday politics/action of being under an authoritarian-neonationalist regime). We need a more case-dependent/sensitive analysis of bringing an interpretative thread to these complex factors, explaining not just the rise but sustenance of neonationalism across the globe.

https://thewire.in/business/delhi-hc-stays-tdsat-order-preventing-prepaid-mobile-subscribers-to-exercise-right-to-portability,Business,Delhi HC Stays TDSAT Order ‘Preventing’ Prepaid Mobile Subscribers to Exercise Right to Portability,"New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed an order passed by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) that prevented prepaid mobile phone subscribers from exercising their right to portability. Justice Rekha Palli issued a notice to Vodafone Idea, seeking its response on a petition filed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) challenging the tribunal’s order that stayed the regulator’s mandate requiring all telecom service providers to permit one text message for portability and receiving a Unique Porting Code. According to Live Law, the impugned TDSAT order dated December 24 had stayed a direction passed by TRAI dated December 7, directing all service providers to enable with immediate effect, for all mobile subscribers, the facility to send SMS on short code 1900, in order to exercise their right to avail porting out facility. The said portability facility is in accordance with the MNP Regulations, 2009. However, Vodafone Idea Limited had introduced some tariff offers or vouchers which did not provide SMS facility to the subscribers, therefore not being compliant from MNP Regulations, 2009 perspective, the TRAI plea said, as per the news report. Trai said in its petition that it had in the past received several complaints from mobile subscribers for not being able to send SMS on short code 1900 for availing the portability facility. The regulator noticed that the telecom service providers were not providing outgoing SMS facility in certain prepaid vouchers. Following this, TRAI asked the telecom operators to allow customers to port mobile numbers with any prepaid or postpaid plan. The TRAI plea states that other service providers like Bharti Airtel Limited and Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited had already complied with the said direction. The judge asked the company “why was it shying away from one SMS” and opined that a stay on the TRAI directive would cause irreparable loss to the public. “I am of the prima facie view that the directions issued on December 7, 2021 in no way take away the freedom granted to the respondent to fix tariff plans. In fact, any interim stay of the direction as done (by TDSAT) will cause irreparable loss to the general public,” the judge said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing TRAI, contended that the December direction was issued in public interest and to ensure that all consumers have the option of mobile number portability, irrespective of their tariff plan not having the text message facility. “Merely because a poor person has taken a prepaid plan for less rupees, he or she cannot be deprived of his or her right to portability, that too when the telecom service provider is required to allow only one SMS, that too on regular charges being levied by it on the consumer,” TRAI said in its petition filed through lawyer Arjun Natarajan. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for Vodafone Idea, defended the stay imposed by the TDSAT and submitted that the telecom operator’s mobile network is already equipped to provide portability to the users. The matter would be heard next on April 25. (With inputs from PTI)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/video/watch-farm-bills-are-an-attempt-to-wipe-out-the-fortunes-of-farmers-p-sainath,Video,Watch | 'Farm Bills Are an Attempt to Wipe Out the Fortunes of Farmers': P. Sainath,"Amidst an uproar and stiff protest, two contentious farm Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha on Sunday, the Farmers Produce (Trade and Commerce) Bill, 2020; and the Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020. The Bills, which seek to replace two ordinances promulgated in June this year, already cleared by the Lok Sabha, were passed by voice vote in the upper house. However, the Bills have seen widespread protests – particularly in Haryana and Punjab, where the BJP’s ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has also expressed opposition to the Bills. In an interview to Mitali Mukherjee, P. Sainath founder editor of the People’s Archive of Rural India said the Bills were an attempt to wipe out the fortunes of farmers. While there were many criticisms of the concept of both the APMC and the MSP, the options being provided would ensure that large corporates would arm-twist farmers into being paid the least remunerative prices. He pointed out that Bihar scrapped its APMC Act in 2006 and there has been no resultant “liberation” of the farm sector. Sainath said farmers were already subject to murderous price fluctuations and the three farm Bills would create major discontent amongst farmers and throw the community into utter chaos. “If the UPA couldn’t shoot straight, the NDA can’t stop shooting,” he said.

https://thewire.in/environment/industrial-corridors-swallow-hundreds-of-fish-species-in-gujarat,Environment,Industrial Corridors Swallow Hundreds of Fish Species in Gujarat,"Ahmedabad: Gujarat has the longest coastline in the country, running into 1,660 kilometres. Its coast is home to 549 villages with a population of more than 30 million. Fishing is the primary source of income for the majority of this population, who are dependent on it either directly or indirectly. There were once more than 300 species of fish along this coastline owing to the diversity of habitat with salt marshes, mangroves and sea grass. However, over the past decade, Gujarat’s coastline has seen an onslaught of industrial corridors. Nearly 60% of Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) undertakings are along the coastline, including petrochemicals units, refineries, thermal power plants, cement and rayon factories and ship-breaking industries. As a result, the habitat of fish has been acutely affected. The coastline of Gujarat now has hardly any catch to offer, forcing fishermen to move deep into the sea. “The concentration of industries along the corridors, such as chemical factories along Vapi and Ankleshwar (Ankleshwar GIDC) in South Gujarat, petrochemicals along Vadodara, rayon and power plants in Saurashtra and power plants and ports in Kutch have rendered the sea coast highly polluted,” says Bharat Patel, an environmental activist based in Kutch. “The Gujarat government has been allowing the release of industrial waste water into the sea. The government doesn’t bother to ensure that effluent treatment plants maintain the norm required for release,” says Rohit Prajapati, an environmentalist based in Vadodara. South Gujarat is the worst affected as Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) in Ankleshwar, Jhagadia and Panoli mostly have chemical and pesticide factories. Industrial waste being disposed into the sea at Kandla. Credit: Damayantee Dhar “In South Gujarat, for example, figures show that industries in GIDC of Ankleshwar, Jhagadia and Panoli have not been treating effluents at the Final Effluent Treatment Plant (FEPT). The figures in January this year show average chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 2,532 mg/litre instead of the norm of 1,000 mg/litre,” Prajapati added. “There are FETP’s set up by government at Vapi, Surat and Ankleshwar for all GIDC’s of South Gujarat but they are equipped to handle 5,000 or 6,000 COD but it is being overloaded by waste water that has about 10,000 COD. Besides these are managed by the industrial association themselves so there is no way to put a check on the right use of these FETPs,” says M.S.H Sheikh, an environmental activist based in Surat. “As a result of the effluents being dumped into the sea, it is fishermen who are suffering. Small fishermen are the worst hit. In coastal villages of South Gujarat that would once have 80-90 boats, not even 10 are left now, as fishermen are opting for jobs like working in factories as daily wage earners. Women of the community who would be primarily engaged in cleaning and selling fish in local market are now travelling to neighbouring urban areas to work as house maids,” adds Sheikh. “It is easier and cheaper for the companies to bribe employees of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and Central Pollution Board than run an effluent treatment plant regularly,” says Bhagvanbhai Solanki, an activist based in Gir Somnath district of Saurashtra. In Saurashtra, between Bhavnagar and Porbandar, there are cement, rayon and ship-breaking industries. Indian Rayon and Industries Limited in Veraval, Gir Somnath, which is now owned by the Aditya Birla group, and Gujarat Heavy Chemical Limited in Sutrapada, Junagadh are one of the oldest industries in the area. Now soda ash manufacturing units by the Tatas, cement factories by Ambuja and Aditya Birla group and a ship-breaking industry based in Alang, Bhavnagar have also come up. “The Indian Rayon and Industries Ltd has a pipeline which is 5 km long and disposes untreated effluent into the sea in Veraval. Sutrapada is worst affected. In fact, the waste from Gujarat Heavy Chemical Ltd has affected coasts along neighbouring tehsils like Hirakoth, Dhamlej and Mul Dwarka. Sutrapada is home to about 10,000 small fishermen. The coast along Sutrapada had natural ‘bara’ (an outlet from where boats would go out into the sea without having man-made port or jetty). Those are destroyed and due to regular disposal of waste there is sedimentation along the coast in the tehsil,” says Solanki. “It isn’t just industry effluent, most coastal cities dump the sewage of the city into the sea,” says Usman Ghani Sherasiya, an activist working amongst the fishermen community in Kutch and Saurashtra. “In the late 1980s, the boats would go for one-day fishing trips. Fishermen would leave early morning and come back by evening. There was so much fish along the coastline that everyone caught enough. Industries started coming up from early 1990s and have been affecting availability of fish along the coastline. As fish became scanty along the coastline, fishermen sailed further ahead into the sea stretching their trips to two or three days to ten days. Now even after a 20-day trip, there isn’t a guarantee that the boat will return with a good catch,” says Bharat Modi, president of the Shree Porbandar Machimar Boat Association. Between 2010 and 2013, Tata, Adani and OPG power plants were set up in Kutch. Nearest to the coast is the Adani power plant at Navinar, Mundra. By 2009, prawns that were abundantly available along the coastline of Kutch were all gone. Lobsters were found around the rocky coast along Modhwa in Kutch. Earlier, on any odd day, fishermen of the area would catch nothing less than 25 kilograms of lobsters in a trip. Now even one kilogram per trip isn’t assured. “Adani ports and SEZ is responsible for large-scale environmental damage such as damaging mangroves, blocking and damaging the creek at various spots thus damaging local ecology at the Mundra project site,” said Sherasiya. A Rs 200 crore fine imposed on Adani Ports as restoration fund imposed by the UPA government was withdrawn by Environment Ministry in 2016. In another instance, Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti, an organisation led by Prajapati, had filed a PIL seeking cancellation of authorisation and environmental clearance granted to industries. The Supreme Court in February 2017 passed an order in the matter ordering all state pollution control boards to issue notices to industrial units to make their effluent treatment plants fully operational in three months i.e. by May 2017. “Nothing has been done in the matter despite the Supreme Court order as of February 2018,” stated Prajapati. A questionnaire regarding the issue has been sent to Indian Rayon, Adani Power and Tata Power. However, they are yet to respond to the same. The story shall be updated once a response is received. For fishermen of Gujarat, the profession is getting more and more difficult. As the availability of fish reduces along the coastline, they are forced to venture farther into the sea. “Prawn, White Pomphret, Dara, Surmai, Chapri, Eel, Palwa and Varara are varieties of fish that were once abundantly available along the coastline between Porbandar and Kutch. These varieties would sell at anything between Rs 300 to Rs 1,500 a kg. Between 1990 and 2000, all these varieties were all gone gradually due to pollution,” says Bharat Modi. Red fish or Lali or Dorara is the only catch fishermen get these days, which sells sells at only Rs 25 per kg. Credit: Damayantee Dhar “Earlier in around 3-5 nautical miles, fishermen would get enough catch to sustain, now there is no guarantee of a sustainable catch even in the deep EEZ till 15 -20 nautical miles. The only option remains to venture into Pakistani waters,” says Sheikh. “It is since 1990, that fishermen began crossing international maritime line for fishing in Pakistan and at times as far as Iran,” says Jivan Jungi, former president of the Shree Porbandar Machimar Boat Association. A fishing trawler typically costs Rs 50,000 to make and boat owners take out loans to buy one. A fishing trip these days would cost about Rs 1.5 lakh, including payment of the fishermen, captain, ice and diesel. A boat in the making in Porbandar. A trawler costs around Rs 50,000. Credit: Damayantee Dhar “There is no guarantee that a boat will return with enough fish that will earn a profit for the boat owner. Many a times a trip doesn’t even pay for the expenses incurred. Hence, despite knowing the risk involved, fishermen venture into Pakistani waters,” says Patel. “When a boat is captured by the Pakistan maritime authorities, the fishermen come back eventually but [Pakistan] keeps the boat. Currently, 1,024 boats are in Pakistan out of which 800 belong to boat owners based in Porbandar. In 2014, 56 boats were given back by Pakistan but all the machinery and parts were taken off them. A boat owner has to pay off the loan he took for a boat he will never get back. Insurance companies refuse to help since their policies are confined to incidents occurring inIndian waters or the high seas but not the territorial sea of Pakistan. There are boat owners who could never recover from the loss. They work in factories to pay off their loans and eventually change professions to sustain their families,” he adds.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/political-economy/saudi-arabias-44-billion-refinery-plan-in-india-faces-farmer-opposition,Political Economy,Saudi Arabia's $44 Billion Refinery Plan in India Faces Farmer Opposition,"Mumbai/New Delhi: At the International Energy Forum in Delhi in April, the world’s top oil producer Saudi Aramco inked a preliminary deal to partner with a consortium of Indian players to build a $44 billion refinery and petrochemical project in Maharashtra. The huge project was touted as a game-changer for both parties – offering India steady fuel supplies and meeting Saudi Arabia’s need to secure regular buyers for its oil. Despite the obvious benefits, though, the prospects for the plan in the works since 2015 – are growing dimmer by the day. Thousands of farmers oppose the refinery and are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. “We earn enough to fulfil our needs and we do not want to surrender our land for a class refinery at any cost,” says Sandesh Desai, standing amid his fruit-laden mango orchard in Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 kilometres South of Mumbai. Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for their livelihood. In 2008, for example, Tata Motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in West Bengal after facing widespread protests from farmers. And while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to ease land acquisition rules to jumpstart delayed projects worth tens of billions of dollars, the government has faced resistance to amending populist laws enacted by his predecessors. Like Desai, a majority of the farmers from 14 villages around Ratnagiri that need to be relocated for the refinery project firmly oppose the plan, a state government official told Reuters. Opposition politicians and even a local ally of Modi’s Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) support the farmer movement, complicating matters further for the government ahead of state and general elections in 2019. The state government, which is responsible for acquiring the land for the project, has so far failed to secure even one acre of the roughly 15,000 acres needed for the refinery, Maharashtra industries minister Subhash Desai said. “The state is not going to acquire land as a majority of the farmers are against the  plan,” said Desai, the minister, who is a member of the Shiv Sena, a regional party allied with the BJP in the Maharashtra state government.  U Under land acquisition rules at least 70% of the land owners need to provide consent for a project, he said. Still, some believe that the opponents are only objecting to get better compensation packages for their land. “Eventually all stakeholders will give their consent, but it will take time,” said Ajay Singh Sengar, who heads a rival forum that supports the refinery project. A local government official in the area said he thought many farmers would agree to a deal once a compensation package was announced. Job promises The Ratnagiri Refinery Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPL), which is running the project, says the 1.2-million-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. But farmers say they have sufficient work in their orchards and fields. “We don’t have enough people to maintain our mango orchards. That’s why every year we employ migrant labour from Nepal,” says Arvind Samant, the secretary of a farmers’ and fishermen’s group that was created to organise opposition to the project. Samant says instead of a refinery, the government should bring agro-processing plants or other industries that suit local needs. Locals protesting against the Ratnagiri refinery project. Credit: NewsClick RRPL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, said suggestions that the refinery would hurt the environment were baseless. It says it will continue to cultivate mangoes and cashews on some 4,500 acres around the project. Despite the opposition, RRPL is hopeful the project will proceed. “Some people misguided farmers and created fear. We’re now trying to answer each and every doubt,” said Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPL, adding that the company was struggling to convince farmers as they refused to even discuss the plan with the company. Hundreds of people have joined non-violent protests, blocking surveyors from even measuring land for the site, said Omkar Prabhudesai, who heads the local group opposing the project. “There is no point in listening to the company’s views. We have already decided not to give our land,” said Prabhudesai. Faint hopes The refinery, announced in 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022, but delays in land acquisition mean the deadline is likely to be pushed back. “Ideally the state government should have acquired land by now and the work for the project should have started. The delay could impact deadlines,” said RRPL’s Nagwekar. Saudi Aramco declined to comment, while India’s oil ministry did not respond to an email seeking comment. Even if the government wanted to implement the project, it would not start any land acquisition process before elections in 2019, conceded a senior state government official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. “Sensing political mileage every political party is opposing the project. For the next one year there won’t be any progress,” the official said. Workers of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), a regional party, vandalised offices of RRPL in Mumbai in April. An MNS spokesman confirmed reports of the incident and said the party was strongly opposed to the plan. Parties like the Congress, and the Nationalist Congress Party also oppose the plan. Still, some officials remain hopeful. Building a large project such as this in India was possible, but could take years, said IOC’s head of refineries Rama Gopal. “We conceived the Paradip refinery project in 1994,” he said, referring to a plan it runs on the East Coast. “But for various reasons the project got delayed and it was finally only commissioned in 2014.” (Reuters)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/diplomacy/india-resumes-e-visa-services-canadians,Diplomacy,"Two Months Later, India Resumes e-Visa Services for Canadians","New Delhi: India has resumed e-visa applications for Canadian nationals, two months after all visa services were stopped after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. While there is no announcement, official sources said that e-visa services have been resumed for Canadian nationals on Wednesday.  On September 21, India suspended visa services, citing alleged ‘security threats’ against diplomatic staff. Indian officials had said that it was not safe for Indian diplomats to process visas in missions in Canada, signalling that Ottawa’s response to its concerns was inadequate. India had also suspended e-visa services for Canadians despite the processing taking place in New Delhi. About a month later, the Indian high commission in Canada announced that it was partially resuming the services for entry, business, medical and conference visas after taking “into account some recent Canadian measures” following a security review. Earlier, Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar had said that New Delhi would resume visa operations if there was substantial “progress” in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats. This time, the e-visa services are being resumed, but not through a formal declaration. After Trudeau made the allegations in the House of Commons, both countries had expelled one diplomat each.

https://thewire.in/south-asia/myanmar-junta-airstrikes-mizoram,South Asia,Myanmar Junta's Airstrikes Have Taken 320 Civilian Lives in 9 Months: Report,"New Delhi: As many as 320 civilians and 108 volunteers of the public defence force resisting the Myanmar coup have lost their lives in air strikes carried out by the junta between October 2022 and June 2023, said the report of a study. The report, put together by Burma Affairs and Conflict Study based on publicly accessible information including news reports, said that in the nine month period, as many as 395 air strikes were conducted by the Military Council.  “These airstrikes can be categorised into three types: exclusive jet fighter strikes, exclusive helicopter  attacks,  or a combination of both. Among these, exclusive jet fighter strikes were the most prevalent.  During the 9-months of monitoring,  a minimum of 108 revolutionary volunteers and  at least 320 civilians lost their lives due to these airstrikes,” said the report put out by the non-governmental watch group on its Facebook page this November 21.  The report pointed out that the highest number of such air strikes took place in the Sagaing region, “with the second highest in Karen state and the third highest in the Chin state.” “The helicopter attacks were mainly used in Sagaing, Magway, Karen State, Shah State and Rakhine State,” it added. Most of these regions are located close to the Indian border. This January, residents of Mizoram’s Champai district claimed that five aerial bombs dropped on a rebel camp in the Chin State by the Myanmarese army had landed on the Indian side. Assam Rifles, who were guarding that border, later denied it. Such attacks on the border villages are, however, considered as the cause behind a refugee influx into Mizoram. Early this week, about 5,000 such refugees entered Mizoram’s Champai district due to the air strikes on the Chin State.   The study report said, “The Military Council, in order to justify their airstrikes, claims that they attack only military targets and deny civilian targets, but data shows that one third of all air strikes  do hit civilian targets.” It said, “Among the airstrikes, strikes during combat was the most with 247 times, followed by 64 attacks on villages in the absence of combat. The airstrikes on the positions of the revolutionary forces were the third highest with 43 times, which is a point to be aware of. In addition, it was also seen that air strikes were carried out on civilian targets such as internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps, churches, clinics, workplaces, schools, monasteries and celebratory gatherings.”  The report names eight military airfields from where these strikes have been carried out. While the pro-democracy rebel militias have succeeded in inflicting massive setbacks to the junta on the ground lately, these air strikes by the military have come to them as significant hurdles.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/books/oblique-power-political-science-research-agenda-emily-hauptmann-book,Books,Oblique Power: How the Wealthiest Few Set the Research Agenda of Political Science,"It is almost banal to say that “knowledge is power” and yet, even then, miss the woods for the trees. Most of us tend to think at a personal level or to see individuals with ‘knowledge’ using it to get what they want. But when we come to think about the small number of institutions that more or less monopolise the production of knowledge – corporations, foundations, universities, state agencies, corporate media – the individualist approach becomes obsolete. Big knowledge is produced by relatively few people linked with or rather employed by and embedded within very rich and powerful institutions wedded to the status quo or to the management of change such that any change is moderate, minimal, functional for elites, and fails to alter the patterns of fundamental power distributions.  There is probably no society quite like the US in this regard. It is a knowledge superpower. Books, magazines, universities, academic journals, scientific patents, intellectual property, Nobel prizes, Hollywood’s cultural output, the global reach of US news and other media – no other society comes close to matching America’s knowledge production and dissemination machine.  Political science as a university discipline is said to have at the heart of its mission to unravel the mysteries of power, who holds it, who benefits, and how it works. That’s the advertising in attractive brochures and glitzy websites. The plain truth is a world apart. Indeed, one could argue that the purpose of political science in the US is to obscure the loci and operations of power, a magic trick of smoke and mirrors that casts a veil over what we, the people, instinctively know is a con though few have the tools to surgically wield a scalpel to pierce that veil. But there are enough political scientists who have such tools and are increasingly using them to devastating effect. Ido Orren’s work stands out, as does Robert Vitalis’s. Orren showed how US political science serves US foreign policy interests. For example, in regard to the portrayal of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in the pages of its flagship journal, American Political Science Review, those states were seen as exemplars of efficient administration and modernisation. In the 1940s, of course and into the post-1945 period, the APSR discovered the dangers of unrestricted state power. Vitalis shows how racist and colonial attitudes saturated the field of international relations (IR), and led to the formation of the elitist Council on Foreign Relations think tank. Its house organ, Foreign Affairs, was originally called the Journal of Race Development and IR as a field had as its focal point the study and management of race relations on a worldwide basis. That is, the maintenance of white supremacy.  Emily HauptmannFoundations and American Political Science: The Transformation of a Discipline, 1945-1970University Press of Kansas (November 2022) Foundations and American Political Science: The Transformation of a Discipline, 1945-1970, Emily Hauptmann’s excellent study, therefore, is welcome and timely. It adds to a growing literature on the subject of the political power of elites, especially philanthropic foundations, and brings in universities as institutions with their own interests in winning research funding from a growing federal budget dedicated to servicing a military-industrial complex driven by Cold War competition. It is well-researched in primary materials, well-organised, and accessibly written. It should be read by all social science scholars, historians of ideas and political science, historians of the development of the American university, and the influence of the Ford, Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. The study of power is at the core of political science  – but who decides how to get to the core of where power lies in any society, how it works, and who matters in politics and political change, is itself a key power. Who defines political science’s core elements therefore sets research agendas, directs funding, builds institutes and departments, dominates professional societies, major disciplinary journals’ orientations and priorities and peer reviewers, who gets promoted and celebrated – and, equally, who does not.   In American political science, the power of the wealthiest few preoccupies a tiny number and proportion of its political scientists’ research agendas, course themes, and reading lists. The rich and powerful do not like and do not fund independent studies of their class, activities or networks. That in itself is power to operate relatively free of scrutiny. It’s also another form of “oblique power” as Emily Hauptmann describes it – it directs attention to the problems of society and politics usually rooted in alleged irrational mass behaviour, the illusions and frailties of the electorate, the power in the land that needs to be educated and informed away from a ‘mob mentality’ and towards reason and realism. American political science is, or thinks it is, that self-proclaimed “secular priesthood” that Walter Lippman wanted to see to handle the dangerous masses, manage the “tyranny of the majority” and engineer the “consent of the governed”. American foundations exercise ‘oblique’ power The obliquely powerful philanthropic foundations at the heart of Hauptmann’s incisive study even define themselves out of the core of power in the US and therefore of the attention of political science. The powerful define themselves as beyond politics, ideology, business, the state – as somewhere else entirely neutral, objective, even scientific – “third sector”. Above and beyond too much scrutiny. Hauptmann’s study deconstructs and effectively and carefully annihilates this self-image in relation to the ‘big 3’ foundations – Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie – their remaking of the vision for the technocratic possibilities of social sciences and the uses of political science. Her focus in this essential and landmark study is those three big foundations and two public research universities – Michigan, and University of California, Berkeley – between 1945-70. The period was transformative the world over, including for the bright shining light that American power promised the world after the defeat of fascism, and the onset of the deadly ideological and military struggles of the Cold War, otherwise better known by historians as US expansionism. Emily Hauptmann has spent years studying the original records of each of the three foundations, numerous personal paper collections, official university records, and oral histories. Those papers have been researched in depth, compared with one another and synthesised and cross-referenced. The resulting book is, therefore, the definitive word on the history and development of US political science, and the forces that conceived of the discipline’s principal preoccupations and methodologies, funded it, shaped its contours, kept it connected with what President Dwight Eisenhower called the ‘military-industrial-complex’. This was a discipline re-made for war and Cold War, the gathering of intelligence on the US electorate, and developing knowledge for use in the titanic struggle between capitalism and communism. It was, therefore, part of the ‘whole-of-society’ elite mobilisation behind US expansionism, against the domestic and global Left, but particularly nationalist anti-colonial struggles in what became known as the ‘Third World’.  Hauptmann places her work in that context – World War II service by leading foundation and academic figures and institutions, that bled liberally into the Cold War, connected symbiotically to the broader US political economy, the power of a growing military-industrial complex and its core in the federal government. The book explores networks of power that span the state and private sectors that implicate both rather than exonerate them for the real world of US power – as dominated not only by great corporate wealth, an increasingly powerful federal government executive and its plethora of national security agencies, and a growing powerful military and even more what C. Wright Mills called the “military definition of reality” in the nuclear age. Political science, area studies, and IR form a nexus here that served to place at the centre of US knowledge-power disciplines that focused on and were rooted in both the imaginary of American exceptionalism at home, to furnish a mission of improvement and reform, and a war machine with personnel from the best universities, the advanced guard of freedom. Book details resistance to elites too Emily Hauptmann has performed a great service to social and political science and understanding – explaining by showing via primary evidence how power really works in liberal democratic America. By so doing she has also exposed liberal democracy’s shortcomings, failings, exclusions, and marginalisations – a necessary by-product of what and whom that society prioritises. In its starkest result, implicitly on the whole, Hauptmann shows how unstable the whole structure really is – because the excluded and marginal are never silent, never consistently weak – the “iron law of oligarchy” of Robert Michels has its counterpart, as Alvin Gouldner said, in an “iron law of democracy”. The book documents the faculty and student resistances that broke out in the 1960s over an array of issues including opposition to the Vietnam War, rejection of the role of many political scientist consultants in the State Department and other agencies, the out-of-touch character of the curriculum. As Professor Sheldon Wolin argued, a significant number of faculty and students wanted a university that enriched human life, and to “end our University’s complicity with… [the Vietnam] war.” Student strikers also argued that universities ought not to “train students to… support, justify, and implement the American world system…” Mainstream political science faculty, however, rejected such calls as “politicising” political science while acknowledging the role so many of their number played in war-oriented agencies of the federal government. As Hauptmann shows, those in power define what is politics and what is not. Headquarters of the US State Department. Photo: AgnosticPreachersKid/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 Building and defending the canon What Emily Hauptmann’s study shows is in effect how the major and oldest US foundations, the US federal government/state, and the postwar research universities built the canon in political science, area studies and IR etc – the core studies in graduate and PhD programmes that defined what the social sciences were supposed to be – questions, issues, theories, methods, cases – and what they weren’t – especially, and starkly, marginalising the likes of Wright Mills’s The Power Elite (1956). It is, therefore, possible to write a deeply researched critical book, based on years of study and toil, and have it either largely ignored or criticised for failing to conform to the dominant methodology.  The wrong kind of knowledge! Thinking the unthinkable. The free market of ideas, denied. The core argument of Hauptmann’s study is that the so-called behavioural revolution in American political science represented a move by several key actors – foundations, universities, and political scientists, each for their specific reasons and interests – was neither inevitable nor necessarily beneficial in studying and understanding how power actually works in the real world of US politics. It was a concerted intervention to produce specific kinds of political scientific legitimate knowledge, with its academic apparatus of journal articles, canonical texts, field leaders, departments, doctoral programmes, and research linked with political institutions, especially the main political parties, the expanding federal government, and the military-industrial complex.  Behaviouralism seeks to uncover and address the behaviours of individuals and groups – voting behaviour for example – in order to generate statistical knowledge for use by the powers that be. Its main focus then is on the electorate and range of interest groups in a competitive system where no class or race monopolises power. Behaviouralism is fundamentally predicated on a pluralistic, mid-20th century version of US democracy, a society of groups engaged in perfect competition with one another. It is also fundamentally positivistic – that is ‘scientific’ and value-free – because, it is claimed, it is based on objective, quantifiable approaches to explain and predict political behaviour. Structures of racial, colonial, elite and class power, gendered patriarchal power relations and institutions, the sinews of social, economic and political life, qualitative studies of documents, texts, of the rich textures of human life, are beyond the canon. They are not ‘real’ political science, according to this view. Of course, there are nuances involved, but most behaviouralists would accept some or all of the above as essential to the postwar revolution in American political science.  The beneficiaries of fellowships and grants from behavioural studies programmes of funding such as Robert Dahl openly challenged Mills’s ruling elite thesis and Floyd Hunter’s community power structures research from an overtly methodological approach – why did they not conduct behavioural decisionmaking case studies – rather than the foundational premises of their analyses of power. Those challenged the pluralistic framing in fundamental ways. Dahl et al therefore in their reactions showed that the knowledge networks around behavioural political science both build a specific kind of discipline as well as defending its turf against resistance and alternatives. In this, their connection with and benefits from what Hauptmann refers to as the “university knowledge economy”, the “postwar federal research economy” and the “organised war research economy” – provide a material explanation. This is no ivory tower – it’s the academic combat at the heart of the canon. Knowledge and power, and power and knowledge, Siamese twins joined at the hip, heart and head. Harold Laski was surely right – it takes a mere announcement by a rich foundation of a funded research programme for numerous scholars to declare that they had always been interested in the matter! As G. William Domhoff, notes: “The agenda underlying Dahl’s 1957 article on the concept of power, which consists of Max Weber souped up with probability equations that never proved useful, became even more obvious in his follow-up paper on power, ‘A Critique of the Ruling Elite Model’, in which he summarily dismissed both Hunter and Mills with the resounding conclusion that it was “a remarkable and indeed astounding fact that neither Professor Mills nor Professor Hunter has seriously attempted to examine an array of specific cases to test his major hypothesis”. Dahl thereby took the substantive issues off the table and turned the argument into a seemingly methodological one, although it was actually an argument about philosophies of science that he was invoking…” Academia is no ivory tower Hauptmann makes very clear that her work stands more in the tradition of Ido Orren, Nicholas Guilhot, and Robert Vitalis – to show how external factors, and not internal ones alone – have powerfully shaped the political science and IR disciplines that are at the heart of legitimising US power – in its geopolitical rivalries, its ideological wars, its construction and defence of racialised-class hierarchies, and defences of colonialism. By focusing in depth on two of the most significant public universities in the United States, whose political science departments rank among the world’s strongest, Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley, Hauptmann’s analysis and conclusions may be considered generalisable to the rest of the American system of higher education.  Indeed, the power of money, and business interests, in American universities is hardly unknown. Thorsten Veblen pointed this out in great detail in his book of 1916 – The Higher Learning in America, the subtitle of which was something like “a memorandum on the conduct of the universities by businessmen”. But because this is precisely the sort of knowledge that dare not speak its name, the message that gets perpetually buried needs repetition, new studies, constant reminders of how and for whom universities actually work. As well as where the resistances emerge from and influence developments.  Emily Hauptmann has done this with great skill and scholarship, through a book that is a must-read, take-note, and act-upon-and-develop with more research. And drive the message home.  It is always impressive to me how much collective effort “individual” freedom takes to produce it – in the ways shown in this remarkable and enduring work – that the system of individual freedom and free enterprise is in fact a vastly orchestrated web of networks and flows of copious amounts of taxpayers’ money over decades and decades; corporate-welfare money that is tax-exempt under cover of its non-political deployments.  It is a vast, complex and dense system of knowledge for combat that builds “empires of the mind” on the material foundations of a state-corporate system of political economy at the centre of a liberal international system whose very foundations appear to be cracked and even crumbling, which finds itself today in its very heartlands being written about by CIA-linked students of civil wars as edging closer and closer to a repeat of 1861-1865.  Inderjeet Parmar is professor of international politics and associate dean of research in the School of Policy and Global Affairs at City, University of London, a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences, and a columnist at The Wire.

According to Israel, 50 Israeli hostages taken by the militant group Hamas during the October 7 terror attacks will be freed – all of them women and children. In exchange, Hamas said Israel will release 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. The deal also includes a four-day “cease-fire” – a term used by Hamas, while Israel has spoken of a “pause in fighting”. Israel said it would extend the lull by an additional day for every 10 hostages released by Hamas. The head of Hamas’s international relations office in Doha, Musa Abu Marzouq, had given extensive details of the hostage-prisoner exchange to The Wire on November 18.  US President Joe Biden, in  a statement, welcomed the deal for a pause in fighting. He thanked the heads of government in Egypt and Qatar – Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt – “for their and partnership in reaching this deal.” Qatar too has released a statement on a humanitarian pause, noting “The humanitarian pause will also allow the entry of a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs.” The State of Qatar announces that a humanitarian pause has been agreed in Gaza#MOFAQatar pic.twitter.com/5qqjSjvt4X — Ministry of Foreign Affairs – Qatar (@MofaQatar_EN) November 22, 2023 
Hamas According to news reports, Hamas has released an official statement that recognises the following terms: — A ceasefire on both sides, a cessation of all military actions by occupation forces in all areas of the Gaza Strip, and a cessation of the movement of its military vehicles penetrating into the Gaza Strip. — The entry of hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, relief, medical and fuel aid into all areas of the Gaza Strip, without exception, in the north and south. — The release of 50 women and children of the occupation’s detainees, all under the age of 19 years, in exchange for the release of 150 women and children of our people from the occupation’s prisons under the age of 19 years, in order of time imprisoned. — Stopping all occupation air traffic in the south for four days. — Stopping all occupation air traffic in the North for 6 hours a day, from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM. During the truce period, the occupation is committed not to attack or arrest anyone in all areas of the Gaza Strip. — Ensuring freedom of movement of people (from north to south) along Salah El-Din Street. Hamas also said, “While we announce the arrival of a truce agreement, we affirm that our hands will remain on the trigger, and our victorious battalions will remain on the lookout to defend our people and defeat the occupation and aggression.” Netanyahu Ahead of the deal’s approval, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed a pause in fighting would not mean the end of the war on Hamas. “We will continue the war until we achieve all of our war aims: To eliminate Hamas, return all of our hostages and our missing, and ensure that there is no element in Gaza that threatens Israel,” he said in a video released on social media. Netanyahu argued that under the deal “not only will the war effort not be harmed, it will enable the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to prepare for the continuation of the fighting.” The Israeli prime minister had told the cabinet that accepting the deal with Hamas was “a difficult decision but it’s a right decision.” With inputs from DW",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/diplomacy/brics-meeting-israel-hamas-gaza,Diplomacy,"As South Africa Points to Gaza 'Genocide', Differences Between India, Other BRICS Members Clear","New Delhi: The BRICS “Extraordinary Joint Meeting on the Middle East situation” on Tuesday (November 21), called by current chair of the grouping South Africa, has served to highlight the difference in opinion between India and other BRICS-plus members on the current situation in Israel-Palestine. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his opening remarks, used strong words to call for an immediate ceasefire and described the situation in Gaza as a genocide. He also held Israel responsible for committing war crimes. Chinese President Xi Jinping too made similar remarks, speaking of the “collective punishment of people in Gaza” and the need for a ceasefire. India, meanwhile, represented by external affairs minister S. Jaishankar, reiterated the need to send urgent humanitarian aid. While Ramaphosa started his speech with a reference to Hamas’s October 7 attack in Israeli that killed more than 1,200 people, the rest of his address focused on the ongoing devastation in Gaza, where over 11,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces since. Both Israel and Hamas, Ramaphosa said, have violated international law: “The actions by Israel are in clear violation of international law, including the UN Charter and the Geneva Convention read together with its protocols. In its attacks on civilians and by taking hostages, Hamas has also violated international law and must be held accountable for these actions.” Using strong words, he continued, “The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians through the unlawful use of force by Israel is a war crime. The deliberate denial of medicine, fuel, food and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount to genocide.” The South African president also situated the current situation in the history of occupation of Palestine. “The atrocities that we have witnessed are the latest chapter in a painful history of suffering, oppression, occupation and conflict going back more than 75 years. The root cause of this conflict is the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel as reflected in UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which states that “Israeli settlements constitutes a flagrant violation under international law.” We therefore urge the international community to agree on urgent and concrete actions to end the suffering in Gaza and establish a path towards a just and peaceful resolution of this conflict,” he said. Ramaphosa demanded an immediate ceasefire, the opening of humanitarian corridors, the release of civilian hostages, a comprehensive dialogue owned by Palestinians and Israelis, and International Criminal Court prosecutions on war crimes. Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar reiterated India’s longstanding policy that Palestinian concerns must be addressed and that a two-state solution is the answer to the difficulties in the region. However, even while speaking of the “immense human suffering” in Gaza, he followed the Narendra Modi regime’s decision not to hold Israel responsible for any deaths over the last five weeks and only spoke of Hamas’s killings. “The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza is causing immense human suffering, including to civilians, elderly, women and children.We welcome all efforts of the international community towards de-escalation. Right now, there is an urgent need to ensure that humanitarian aid and relief effectively and safely reach the population of Gaza. It is also imperative that all hostages are released. We believe that there is a universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law,” Jaishankar said. While condemning the attack by Hamas, Jaishankar did not name the Israeli state when talking about the subsequent crisis and civilian deaths. “We are all aware that the immediate crisis was triggered by the terrorist attack of 7th October. Where terrorism itself is concerned, none of us should or can compromise with it. Hostage taking is equally unacceptable and cannot be condoned. Subsequent developments have deepened our concern even more as we witness large scale civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis. We strongly condemn any death of civilians,” he said. Speaking of India’s position on Palestine, he said, “We believe that the concerns of the Palestinian people must be addressed in a serious and sustainable manner. This can only happen with a two-State solution that is based on peaceful co-existence. We have been consistently supportive of international efforts towards this end.” Jaishankar also mentioned the humanitarian relief India has already sent to Gaza, and said that such efforts will continue. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend the BRICS meeting as he is currently campaigning for the upcoming assembly elections in Rajasthan. Among the BRICS members, both old and new, India and Ethiopia were the only two to abstain in the voting for the UN General Assembly Resolution that called for humanitarian pause to allow for supply of food, fuel and water to the Gaza Strip. All the other members had voted in favour. On October 7, Hamas launched a terror attack from Gaza strip into southern Israel and killed more than 1,400 people. Since then, Israel launched counter-strikes into Gaza which has left more than 14,000 people dead, as per last official count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jaishankar reiterating that the “real issue” was the space given to “extremism and radicalism”. At a media briefing on Tuesday, Jaishankar confirmed that the Canadian issue was raised during the talks with his Australian counterpart, Penny Wong, who was also in Delhi to attend the ‘2 plus 2’ meeting. Noting that Australia had “good strong relationship” with both India and Canada, he said, “So, it was important that Australia get our perspective on the issue.” “From our point of view, the key issue is really the space which is being given to extremism and radicalism in Canada,” he said. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong said that she had listened to Jaishankar’s perspective, but she didn’t repeat Canberra’s position. “I will point to my previous comments on this matter on which I have responded on a number of occasions.” Relations between India and Canada nose-dived after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went public with a potential involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar on June 18 in British Columbia. India considers Nijjar to be a Khalistani terrorist. India firmly dismissed Trudeau’s claims as “absurd” and “motivated”. India and Canada expelled a senior diplomat each in a tit-for-tat measure. Besides, India also stopped all visa services for Canadians, which was partially resumed earlier this month. Additionally, India enforced “parity” in diplomatic representation at Canadian missions, leading to the withdrawal of 41 diplomats. After Trudeau had made the accusations in September, Wong had expressed “deep concern” at the allegations and said that it had been conveyed at senior levels to India. At that time, Wong’s statement had also noted that the allegations could be “particularly concerning to some Australian communities”. “The Indian diaspora are valued and important contributors to our vibrant and resilient multicultural society, where all Australians can peacefully and safely express their views,” she said, through her spokesperson. In an interview to The Hindu newspaper, Wong was asked whether Australia had taken action against Khalistani extremist groups as requested by India. “In relation to that I’d say is we respect your sovereignty. And we also are very clear about the line between peaceful protests, freedom of expression and violence and vandalism,” she said, during her current visit to India. Last month, Australia’s head of domestic intelligence reiterated the ‘Five Eyes’ nations’ backing of Canada, stating that there was “no reason to dispute” Trudeau’s assertions regarding the involvement of the Indian government agents in the killing of a Canadian citizen. The ‘Five Eyes’ network is an intelligence-sharing alliance that comprises the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A press release issued by Israeli embassy said Tel Aviv had listed Lashkar-e-Taiba as a “terror organisation” to mark the “15th year of commemoration of the Mumbai terror attacks”. Ten members of the LeT terror group had entered the city of Mumbai on the night of November 26, 2008. Over the course of four days, they killed 166 people and injured 300. One of the locations targeted by the terrorist was a Chabad centre at Nariman House. Four Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks. “Despite not being requested by the Government of India to do so, the state of Israel has formally completed all necessary procedures and has satisfied all required checks and regulations to the result of introducing Lashkar-e-Taiba into the Israeli list of illegal terror organisations,” said the press note. The embassy stated that the Israel “only lists terror organisations who are actively operating against it from within or around its borders, or in a similar manner to India – those globally recognised by UNSC or the US state department”. The LeT had been listed as a terror group by the UN Security Council’s panel in 2005. The US state department had designated LeT even earlier in 2001. The press readout noted that the Israeli ministries of defence and foreign affairs “jointly worked in the last few months towards an expedited and extraordinary listing of the Lashkar-e-Taiba organization on this date, to highlight the importance of a Unified Global Front in combating terrorism”. Israel described the LeT as “deadly and reprehensible terror organization, responsible for the murder of hundreds of Indian civilians as well as others. Its heinous actions on November 26, 2008 still reverberate in force, through all peace seeking nations and societies”.  Following the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, Israeli ambassador Naor Gilon had asked India to declare the Palestinian group as a terror organisation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had immediately expressed “solidarity” with Israel on October 7, which he reiterated in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. India had to nuance its position by speaking about its traditional support for Palestine a week later. However, India had one of the few countries in the Global South which abstained on the resolution in the UN General Assembly that called for a humanitarian pause to allow the supply of food, fuel and water into Gaza strip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President Joe Biden handed out chocolate boxes to costume-clad kids who lined up to meet him, and adorably feigned horror at some of their costumes. Among the kids were Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s son, who came dressed as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and daughter, who came dressed as Ukraine itself. Nobody came to Biden’s party dressed as Israel or Palestine, where, half a world away, the war was getting even more horrific, with Israel beginning to target the most densely populated areas of Gaza as part of its retaliation to the Hamas terror attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis on October 7. Israeli air strikes pounded Gaza’s largest refugee camp, flattening apartment buildings and triggering apocalyptic scenes. Children were seen carrying other injured children to safety amid hysterical screams, picking their way through the gray dust and the fresh rubble scattered with the dead and the dying. Six times as many children have been killed in Gaza in the three weeks of the conflict than the total number of children killed in the entire Ukraine war. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed so far in Gaza, which the UNICEF calls a “graveyard” for children, who account for more than 40% of the dead. The UN Children’s Fund estimates 420 children are killed or injured in Gaza every day, “a number which should shake each of us to our core.” An unshaken Biden, who has extended unconditional support and military assistance to Israel and has opposed a ceasefire, has feigned disbelief at the numbers. That puts him at odds with the outpouring of global condemnation at the impunity with which civilian lives are being erased in what the United Nations calls “collective punishment.” Israeli historian Raz Segal, who studies the Holocaust and modern genocide, calls it a “textbook case of genocide.” Even national leaders, many of them close US allies, are not mincing their words and are breaking ranks with the American policy of de facto carte blanche. As the war intensifies and the body bags pile up, US double standards on the victims of Ukraine and Gaza invasions become glaringly obvious, especially in the Global South that is often subject to American sermons on liberty and human rights. These days the only thing the leading custodian of the liberal international order seems to be liberal with is brown bodies. Broad condemnation Like Segal, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sees the military campaign as a genocide. Malaysian Prime Minister and democracy icon Anwar Ibrahim calls it the “height of barbarism.” Belgium wants sanctions on Israel for the “inhumane” air strikes. France wants Israel to stop bombing and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Israel needs to stop killing babies. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, another US ally, stresses that “every Palestinian life matters” and is urging Israel to observe the rules of war, which UN secretary general António Guterres accuses Israel of grossly violating. The high priests of the liberal order are invoking anti-Semitism to combat any critique of Israel. France is considering jail terms for “insults” to Israel, while the British government likens anti-war demonstrations to “hate marches.” But to many people outside the West and the Islamic world – with no natural solidarity with the Palestinians or baggage of guilt about the Holocaust that automatically treats criticism of the Israeli state as anti-Semitism – the human tragedy wreaked on Gaza is simply unacceptable. The heartbreaking images from the conflict evoke horror at the unrestrained mutilation of the norms of accepted state behaviour, and the helplessness of the global system of laws and institutions in stopping it. Gaza increasingly looks like the killing fields of the “rules-based order” that the Biden administration has made its mantra. If this carnage in Gaza is part of an “order” of any kind, pray what disorder looks like. This wouldn’t be the first time for the rules-based order to be profaned, of course. Israel is only pummeling what little credibility was left of it after the unilateral excesses of Iraq and Ukraine invasions. But the international backlash on Gaza reflects an unprecedented crisis of moral authority of the liberal order, in particular the US, which has spearheaded its making since the end of the Second World War and embedded its global leadership in its institutions. Gaza raises serious questions about America’s actions and judgment, and by extension the very legitimacy of the liberal order that it evangelizes. Questions like, what is the rationale of pulling out troops from Afghanistan to leave its people to their fate in the hands of the Taliban and then surging troops in the Middle East? Or, what is the rationale of opposing occupation in Ukraine and backing it in Gaza? Or, why is it that the only Muslims that America seems to care about are the ones who live in China? In a world horrified by the sights of Gaza, the optics of Biden flying to Israel and hugging its leader, America’s casual acceptance of the inevitability of mass-scale civilian deaths in Gaza, its blocking of even “humanitarian pauses” in the UN to get in lifesaving aid, and its assistance to Israel to carry on the war, call into question like never before the fairness and capability of the current rules-based multilateralism, as well as America’s credentials in leading it. UN failures The UN system is at the core of this liberal multilateral order, and its current state is a fair indicator as to why the liberal order is flailing. Presenting the plan to set up the United Nations, US president Franklin Roosevelt promised Congress in 1945 that it would “spell the end of the system of unilateral action, the exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the balances of power, and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries.” Let alone stopping the unilateral bombing in Gaza, the UN has failed even to protect its own staff from it. More than a hundred  of its members have been killed in Israeli bombardment of UN facilities, which are supposedly inviolable in conflict situations as a matter of rule. Vested with the authority to enforce peace, the UN has seldom looked this powerless. Its helpless pleas for peace on social media make it look every bit the sideshow that it has been reduced to – by the very power that swears by it. The grand promise of the “rules-based order” that Biden dangles to the Global South has thus never rung hollower. His administration uses it as a catch phrase to consolidate a global alliance against an ascendant China that it claims is out to wreck the liberal order. But China has in fact shown much greater respect for the “rules” in this conflict and has come across as a more responsible power by firmly opposing Israel’s retaliatory excesses and calling for a ceasefire, unlike America’s steadfast opposition to it despite the UN’s repeated appeals. America’s response to the crisis has undermined both its assertions of moral superiority over its new cold-war rival and the liberal order, which has already been under scrutiny. Quest for alternatives The new powers in an emerging multipolar world argue that it is too West-centric and lacks diversity and accountability. Global South groupings like BRICS are seen as budding platforms prepping for an alternative alignment of power with a different set of rules of engagement. Might Gaza hasten the process? Could the liberal order survive the single greatest instance of its delegitimization? These may be trying times for the liberal order, which is bad news at a time of a worldwide rise of right-wing authoritarians peddling toxic nationalism. But it may still not be the end of days for it. The Global South is hardly a homogenous entity. Sample the difference between India’s strong backing of Israel and the pro-Palestine stance of other BRICS founding members. Scholars of international order such as John Ikenberry have long argued that the American liberal hegemonic order may be in crisis, but not the liberal order itself as there is no grand alternative to it, and as American unipolarity fades and other powers emerge, there will appear new international leaders happy to engage with, and own, the liberal order. All emerging and middle powers such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, while wanting to imbue global governing institutions with what they consider their own national values and interests, have also engaged actively with the rules-based order, not rejected it. So the rules-based order won’t die from the wounds of Gaza even as its moral failure makes it more vulnerable than ever before to demands for change. But Gaza could well mark that moment of transition when it ceases to be the preserve of an America seen to be too partisan or too powerless to mediate the rules fairly. The moment of transition that marks America’s passing as the dominant global power in the eyes of the rest of the world. Whatever form it takes after it emerges from Gaza’s rubble, the liberal order will not be America’s to wield any more. Debasish Roy Chowdhury is a journalist based in Hong Kong.

Story 9: October 31, 2023 “Daddy, who invented the Israelis?” A few moments after heavy shelling by our house, my 7-year-old daughter, whose body was trembling with fear, put her trembling hand on my cheek and asked: “Daddy, who invented the Israelis? Why do they do this to us? Tell them it’s enough!” A simple, innocent question that I could not answer with all my mental strength… I chose to hold her instead and bring her and her siblings to my chest. I told them: “Don’t fret, we are all together fighting our fear.” And so I looked at my eldest daughter, who became a teenager just a few months ago, and is fully aware of what is happening. She looked at me silently as if asking: “But you are terrified, father. I feel your heartbeats as if they beat outside your chest.” I kissed her forehead and said: “It’s ok. The bravest are those who are scared for the most precious in their lives. Do you see how brave we are!?” Roo7 is a mental health professional, anonymous for fear of being targeted. Story 10: November 2, 2023 This is the 22nd day of war. I’m used to helping people figure out their emotions and let them be. Today, I don’t know what to do with my own sadness anymore. I stopped counting how many family members and loved ones I lost. How can I do that when I’m trying to alleviate the pain and suffering of my kids, who also lost many of their friends and classmates?! For me as a mother, death is not the worst part in this story. The worst part are all those images and thoughts that won’t leave the minds of almost everyone in Gaza: will we die instantly when attacked? Will we continue to suffer alone alone under the rubble for many hours or maybe days? Will we feel too much pain while dying? Will we die together? Will one or more of the youngest kids live without the rest of the family? Then where and how? Will our bodies turn into pieces? Will we feel the pain of losing a limb? My kids ask me questions, and I try to answer in a language they can understand. How can I talk about death, that’s all around, in an age-appropriate way? How do I tell my kids to prepare for scenarios like surviving without the rest of us or being severely disabled, or both? Dana, my 11-year-old daughter said: “Mum, if it happens that I die and you all survive, please all of you imagine as if I’m in front of you and talk to me everyday.” “Why?” I asked. She was sobbing as she answered: “because I’ll miss you there.” Eman Abu Shawish is a mental health practitioner at UPA, Gaza, Palestine. Story 11: November 3, 2023 My name is Naheel and I am 28 years old. I don’t know how much life or time I have left before my mission in this life is over. I would like to tell you parts of my story before I run out. Today happens to be the 28th day of the attacks on Gaza. It is as if each year of my life corresponds to a day of the war. My family and I lived through many brutal, lonely nights and we sustained damages in our home from the heavy, incessant shelling. We opted to stay and die dignified in our home over roaming between places we cannot prove are any more or less safe… People are being targeted at schools, hospitals, bakeries, buildings, and “safe areas.” Naheel and Nisreen. Photo: From the UPA website On the twenty fifth day, though, I did not anticipate the loss of my best friend, my sister and comrade in challenge and struggle and humanitarian work. Her name was Nisreen. My phone rang. Someone said: “Your friend, Nisreen, is now under the rubble and has been missing for a day and a half; they couldn’t pull her out…!” “That is not true!! This is a joke!!” I replied. I felt paralysed and am still in disbelief since. I stayed in bed. I couldn’t breathe. I felt suffocated. I wondered every second if my friend was still alive…!! I was hopeful and consoled myself thinking she would survive. After two days of overthinking and helplessness, they told me “we pulled out your dead friend, as she has risen along with all her family members.” My friend and her family were totally wiped out. She was erased like she never existed. Her family was ambitious and life-loving, like mine. What is this deep pain! I lost my comrade in ambition and struggle. How am I going to resume my doctoral journey without her, if I am destined to live?? Before the war, Nisreen was finishing up her thesis and prepping for her master’s defense and wedding ceremony… Everyday since, I look at our pictures and memory album. My heart bleeds from pain. I tell myself “no, she didn’t die, this is a nightmare and I will wake up from it. I must wake up. My friend still has a lot to give life and our friendship…” I wish I died before living the pain of this loss. And who knows when I would lose my picture album and any memories I have in my home… On that barbaric day, I lost a beautiful soul as pure as an angel. And how? In a fire belt!!!!! And how can I live with this rupture in my heart and soul. We always left a special mark in our humanitarian work, helping people and alleviating some of their pain. All we wanted was to reduce some of the burdens our people that they unduly carried, especially those children who lived through traumas, many wars, incessant aggression, crises, and never-ending conflict. I have so much energy that can fill up an entire planet and so much passion to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology as well as improve myself and serve people. I like children and I like to work and live and travel and move and be free and have those rights like any other normal human being… I lost my dream, my journey, and my loving supportive friend. The bride-to-be has now become a bride of paradise and got the highest achievement of meeting her Maker, along with her family. As for me, with all this loss, I have not lost my life just yet!!! Naheel Al Qassas is a mental health professional, UPA – Gaza, Palestine. Story 12: November 4, 2023 The fifth day of war.
It’s 11:00 am. I made some tea and the kids sat around me, as I was considering some activity we can do to reduce the repercussions of the horrific night before. Before any of us took a sip of the tea, we heard a loud explosion. Sounds of breaking glass and things falling. The house suddenly filled up with black smoke that caused partial darkness and a suffocating odour, and everyone started coughing. The metal drape fell on my head, but I didn’t care. All I was focused on was getting wet towels to cover the kids noses so they don’t suffocate. Then we all ran towards the ground floor with the two young girls hanging on to my clothes, only to find the stairs also full of broken glass. I took the kids inside the house on the ground floor and headed towards the building entrance to look for my eldest son. He was waiting for any vehicle selling drinking water, while his father was waiting in a bakery line to buy some bread. I was searching and telling myself: “Please, God, protect my son and husband and don’t separate us.” I felt my heart beat fast and my thoughts racing back and forth. I kept searching in the burning street that was full of smoke and rubble. I deeply thanked God when I found him safe and sound. The smoke subsided only for us to discover the martyrdom of three children from three of the families of our neighbours. One of the children had gone up to the roof to feed the rabbit kittens. He used to adore those kittens and care for them like they were little babies… We also found a number of injured people. The families whose homes were damaged started moving to other places. My youngest daughter, Fayruz, who is 7 years old, bid farewell to her friends. Little did she know that they will be targeted in the houses they went to, and two would die and rise. We spent around an hour and a half in the ground floor until my children’s bodies stopped shaking enough so they could walk, and we went back up to our home. I quickly swept the broken glass and the fallen things, and pulled down the windows that were partially broken so the pieces don’t fall on pedestrians on the street. And when I was done, I started feeling the whiplash in my head from the fallen metal drape, which remained for a few days afterwards. I looked at my kids who were gathered in a corner, crying. I hugged them all and before I uttered a word, Fayruz said: “I pray I die and rise so I get rid this of this fear.” Dana said: “Mommy, I feel I am dead… I feel I am not alive… mama, do you see me?” I performed some quick psychological interventions, and then I allowed them all some space to talk freely about their experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Eventually, I suggested we draw. Dana, my 11-year-old, drew the attached picture.  She explained her drawing: “This is a house that was shelled and fell on people, and this girl said No God But Allah before she died. She is really scared and very sad and nobody can save her from the rocket.” Eman Abu Shawish is mental health professional with UPA – Gaza, Palestine. Story 13: November 4, 2023 The 30th day of the war… Fifth of November… Today, my baby Fayruz completes her 7th year. Since over 3 months ago, she has been counting the days waiting for this day. I swear she was counting them one day at a time, and asked me every day: “How much longer till my birthday?!” She had a grand plan with the details of this day. I say grand for her as a child from Gaza, but it could be a perfectly ordinary day for kids in the rest of the world… maybe even less than ordinary. Her plan has a colourful cake imprinted with the cartoon character Elsa; 7 colourful candles; some marshmallows; decorations; birthday fireworks; balloons; a list of guests that includes some classmates and friends from our neighbors; and a whole lot of fun! Then go out with the family on some outing, perhaps to eat shawarma, or play in one of the kids’ arcades. Since the start of the war and despite her young years, Fayruz realized that her dream of a birthday celebration is slowly vanishing… She felt that celebrating is a form of treason to the thousands of children who passed, and to the pains and fears of those who are still alive… I feel sorry for her heart that learned very early how sorrrow competes with joy and wins, and how death attacks life and destroys it. Let us get back to her plan: As for the cake, bakeries here can barely make bread and no room for cakes, and there is no gas to bake one at home… As for the candles, those were replaced with bombs that light up the sky and never leave… As for the fireworks, don’t worry, we have explosions anytime… As for the decorations and balloons, they have no place on cracked walls that are filled with smoke… As for the list of guests, it has friends who became martyrs before they even knew about the invite, friends who are grieving the losses of loves ones, and friends we know nothing about after ways of communication were severed… And as for the outing after the party, there is no place left standing in Gaza, no restaurant or arcade or even a street… everything turned into rubble… As for joy, I thank God she is still a child, and is overtaken by a pure and uncorrupted instinct to pursue happiness and fun… That instinct that gave her sparkling eyes in the morning as she joyfully yelled: “Mama today is my birthday!” I hugged and kissed her and said: “Happy birthday, happy birthday my sweetheart!” Suddenly, her eyes stopped sparkling and she said: “Is it ok to throw a party? It’s not ok, right?” I looked at her lovingly and said: “Whatever you want, what would you like to do?” She smiled and hid her head in my lap and asked: “Do they bake a cake in war?” And she meant the bakeries. I smiled and replied: “We will see, we will get one if we can find it, but what shall we do if couldn’t find any?” She was silent. I suggested: “If we couldn’t find a cake, we can celebrate with marshmallows.” (We had bought some the day before as this was the last ingredient in our plan.) She screamed: “Yaaaaaaaaay!!!” My heart danced to the amount of happiness in her eyes, so I added: “God-willing, we will have a nice birthday after the war.” She abruptly asked me: “And what happens if we die as martyrs?” One of her sisters saved me and said: “If we die as martyrs, we will throw the nicest birthday party in Heaven.” This, dear friends, is childhood in Gaza. A dream blockaded by scoundrels from every corner; scoundrels who wage sudden wars that won’t let a simple child’s dream ever be fulfilled. Eman Abu Shawish is a mental health practitioner at UPA, Gaza, Palestine. Note from UPA: Realising the discrepancy with the specified birthday on November 5; I could not get hold of Eman to clarify because all communications were cut off again. Story 14: November 6, 2023 Stolen birthday moments: We spent most of the day trying to prepare some food for the family. This took a very long time because we used firewood that takes time to light and can only accommodate one pot at a time. Red eyes and continuous shedding of tears are not important, nor are the fire burns on our hands. What really matters is that I don’t see them hungry, or have a guilt scar in my heart if any of them, God-forbid, were to become martyrs while craving food… After we were done cooking, we changed our clothes. We gathered around to read some verse from the Qur’an before it turned dark. Darkness has been arriving much earlier than usual these days. The kids sat on the floor of the room we have been sleeping in since the beginning of the war. I arranged the pieces of the marshmallow in a plastic plate and placed an electronic candle in the middle. In another plate, I put what we could scavenge of biscuits, and I walked towards them holding the two plates whilst singing: happy birthday to you… Fayruz was the first to clap! Then her siblings followed as they sang with me. If the cells in her body could speak, they would have told us they were dancing in joy. And if I could, I would have thanked the darkness for hiding the avalanche of tears on my face that I could not control… I cried because of my daughter’s purity and innocence; that daughter who was elated with less than peanuts… or maybe I cried because I tricked time and stole for my kids and I 18 minutes of joy, of genuine smiles, of warm wishes, before an airstrike targeted a nearby location that shook the ground, the building, and our hearts… and my kids all returned to my lap and shoulders and sides, where they belong… and we start over the rituals of fear and fake sleep. This, dear friends, is childhood in Gaza. A dream blockaded by scoundrels from every corner; scoundrels who wage sudden wars that won’t let a simple child’s dream ever be fulfilled. And so we replace it by a reality that we can force, until life or death finds its way to us. Eman Abu Shawish is a mental health practitioner at UPA, Gaza, Palestine. Story 15: November 7, 2023 Decapitated Dream Here I write to you with honest feelings and heavy emotions. I, like any person on this earth, have unfulfilled ambitions and dreams. Today I share my pain over education and educators. Oh how passionate I am about knowledge and learning! My college journey from the bachelor’s to master’s was no ordinary one; it was filled with adventures, stories, and memories that I hope I can narrate to my children one day. Throughout seven long years of working under temporary contracts with lack of job security and professional stability, in a dire Palestinian reality, I never succumbed to obstacles and challenges that seemed to be thrown at me from every direction. I used to work with my colleagues under severe injustice, inhumane siege, poor economic conditions, and a difficult financial situation. I have always dreamt of the moment I would be able to pursue postgraduate studies. I patiently awaited my chance and booked my spot in the master’s program with 40 dinars. My family and I saved as much money as we could to finance my studies and pursue my dream. Always on my mind was the Hadith of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) on pursuing knowledge: “Whoever follows a path seeking knowledge, God will make easy for him a path to Paradise. Indeed, the angels lower their wings in satisfaction with what the seeker of knowledge does; and everything and everyone in the skies and the earth, and even the fish in the water, seek and pray for their forgiveness. The favor of the scholar over the worshiper is like the favor of the moon over all the other planets, and the scholars are the heirs of the prophets. The prophets did not leave behind a dinar or a dirham, but rather they left behind knowledge, so whoever takes it will receive an abundant share.” This Hadith was my strongest motive to persist. And I started my master’s program. All my professors used to motivate me to continue. I will never forget the mark of Dr. Anwar, Chairman of the Psychology Department, God’s mercy be on his soul. He was adamant on creating the doctorate program in psychology at the Islamic University in conjunction with Al-Azhar University. I also remember Dr. Osama, God’s mercy be on his soul, who has risen as a martyr in this aggression. Also I note Dr. Jamil, the man with the incredible sense of humor, may God protect him, who once told me: “You, Naheel, will be a doctor. You are real and intuitive, for your character is special. Even your face is joyful!” I laughed and said: “I would feel so blessed if I just finish my master’s degree!” I remember many of my professors who pushed me to pursue graduate studies on women and children. They had much faith in my potential and abilities and all this I merit to God first, then to my parents, then to every professor who taught me. And I will not forget my Godfather in my clinical and academic journey, Dr. Moustafa El-Masry, who helped shape my personality to the better. I am indebted to him for life and want to be a clinical supervisor, just like him! I feel a strong sense of belonging to my university and community there. I always searched for scholarships to study clinical psychology abroad, and went through the full process. I wished to bring knowledge back to the people of Gaza and join my professors in disseminating knowledge and enriching life. But it was the wisdom of God that my destiny was to stay and study in Gaza and serve my people and my country. And so I started graduate school while balancing study with work and life. After hard work, exhaustion, and much hardship, finally the signs of success started to show. I got to the last semester my master’s degree and my dream was shining inside of me. I cannot describe how proud and happy I felt! I stood tall and proud in front of the obstacles of life and this dream buried inside of me! But my joy was incomplete… Suddenly, one day, I woke up to the sounds of heavy shelling. The first shock was the bombardment of the buildings of my university. This educational edifice is not just buildings and departments. That university represents the character of the sincere, educated, hardworking, loyal, honest Palestinian person. It is also a podium for scholars and scholarship and is considered the second home for every student ever enrolled in it. Now, the educational career is destroyed, and so is the university with this mad shelling. Dr. Anwar, Dr. Osama, and Dr. Ibrahim were all killed… so many of the faculty were killed… I will no longer listen to their lectures nor receive their encouragement except in my memories… and we will not resume together the path seeking knowledge and wisdom… what a loss and what a tragedy… My thesis was burnt and so were all my papers… no more homework to grade and no more idols to evaluate and guide… I felt as if a giant rocket targeted my heart!! All my dreams were shattered in front of my eyes. I cried with all my senses; I cried as if I had never cried before. As if the dream in Gaza turned into void and was put on hold until further notice… AAAAAAHHHH… between our rosy dreams and making them a reality lies a grey, ugly war!! I was raising this dream as if it was a baby I was nurturing and caring for… I could not express how I felt; all the words and letters disappeared; and I left my dreams in the hands of God like any human who could not find anyone but God to help them, and I cried out loud: “On this earth exists what deserves life, hope and love…!” And I tell you: “We love life if we could find a way to it.” (Note – both quotes from the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish). We are not numbers; for every one of us has a story, a dream, a memory, and an ambition. My dream is what keeps me alive to this day. And from the heart of pain hope is born, for we are alive, staying, and the dream will be continued. Naheel Al Qassas is a mental health professional, UPA – Gaza, Palestine. Story 16: November 9, 2023 Raji is the youngest of my siblings. My little brother is a sensitive and warm person. He’s ambitious and has a big dream to become a civil engineer. Raji loves life, soccer, and playing with our niece, Elia. Raji witnessed all the wars on Gaza since he was born, and he did not enjoy his childhood like other kids… and he hasn’t achieved any of his dreams in this life… My brother’s fears are my biggest worry, for each time I look at Raji, I see hope in the future. Now, I feel major helplessness towards him as if I carry the burden of the responsibility of his well-being over my shoulders. He has seen nothing of this life, except nonstop war and destruction. My father always told me: “Naheel, I have grown old and not much of life is in me. My health may fail any day, and my duties on this earth will end with it. I worry for little Raji who has not yet accomplished what you and your siblings did academically, nor has he had any chances at life yet. I ask you to embrace and care for him like I did for you.” Those words of my father’s linger in my ears and continue to pain me more and more. Raji says he feels bored, exhausted, and scared. He always repeats: “I am bored and sick of the shelling! When will we be rid of it? I am scared of death!” The hardships of life have stolen Raji’s childhood and forced him to grow up early, just like it did to other children in Gaza. Raji asks question beyond his age and has thoughts bigger than his youth. For he thinks about death before he could live; and aches of loss before he could enjoy existence.” Every night, he says: “I want to sleep next to mom so we die together.” And he tells my mom: “Don’t leave me for I will go with you to Heaven!!” He feels extremely angry at rockets and the sound of drones and wonders: “why do they bomb us! I feel I am about to die! God, when will this war end?! I want to go to school and see my friends! I know nothing about them and am terrified they are all dead in this war that is killing all kids my age…” Naheel Al Qassas is a mental health professional, UPA – Gaza, Palestine. Story 17: November 12, 2023 I turned 30, three days ago! Happy birthday to me. I welcomed my birthday as we are stifled under the strongest, most difficult attack we faced in our combat history. I say our combat history because we, or at least I, have witnessed many wars and aggressions that the sieged Gaza Strip has lived for many years. I think of thirty years that passed, of the entrenched fear I developed of losing my family, home, and my loved ones. In the past, I thought I understood what it meant to be occupied, but turns out I had no idea! I thought I understood occupation when I suffered bitterly in my experience with Sofia, the birdie of my heart gifted to me a few years into my marriage. Visiting Sofia, whom I delivered in occupied Jerusalem at the time, required me to get permission from the Israelis, their permission to go see my daughter who was born at 6-month-gestation. She, her father, and I were in desperate need to be with each other when she was in the incubator. But it so happens that the occupier’s law prohibits parents from being together in the hospital, and provides a permit only for one member of the family at a time, and for a maximum period of one week… how much I needed my husband next to me and how much Sofia needed both of us together… and how many difficult decisions we had to make from afar, without looking into her eyes… At that time, I used to existentially ponder upon our situation. The struggle begins at the Erez Crossing, where you are forced into a long search from head to toe! You see soldiers and officers everywhere with their heavy artillery, arrogantly looking around, with their fingers on the trigger, ready to attack in cold-blood and empty all their bullets in the head of the victim, as per usual. I have passed through Erez many-a-time and every time I feel sadness, bitterness, and terror over our state of affairs, for we have no prints in this part of the occupied land. You see female recruits all around, and you can’t help but wonder how can a woman be so harsh on another woman this way… how does she not see that had she been born on the other side of the line, she would be in my place… you see Israeli flags everywhere, and surveillance cameras in every square meter, no kidding! At the time, I thought I knew what it me to be occupied. To be occupied means that your enemy obliterates any marks of the the native people that could prove they had right over the land. To be occupied means that you feel like an alien in your own homeland. Every time I went to Jerusalem, I would stand at the window of my hotel room and ball my eyes out for hours. I walk in the alley and look at people’s faces and I cry. I cry for feeling like a foreigner in my own homeland. I cry because I was lonely, lonely, lonely with Sofia who was fighting under those machines that keep her alive… Often, I used to wish that Mohammad and I could go visit Sofia together. I wished she would see us together so she feels our love and what it means to have a family! But we were deprived of that, too, because our permissions to go together were always declined, for their fear that we would stay there. And “there” is the part of the land that was previously snatched from us, and thus our simple existence becomes a threat to their fake country; for we are a living proof of the horrific mess by which this land was stolen, the proof that refuses to disappear. Because of this, I do understand their paranoia about the original people of the land. Sometimes I would go visit Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock to pray in that blessed, sacred place, hoping to feel that some evidence of our history and existence here still remains; that I find some peace there. I used to worship and cry a lot!! I cry because in a few hours I will have to leave Sofia alone again and return to Gaza, not knowing when I will be allowed to see her again… and I cry at our whole situation! But even in my miserable attempts to feel some peace and safety, I only felt more bitterness and pain! For wherever you looked, you would see Israeli police, looking at you like a hungry cat ready to jump at its prey; ready and wishing for the moment in which they end your life! Despite all this, I never truly understood the meaning of occupation until today. As we try to survive the most brutal of wars we have witnessed, I finally started to grasp what it means to be occupied. Today. Between death and us is zero distance, and nobody is reaching out to do us justice! Occupation as I see it now is that one party moves as far as possible from their humanity to chase their greed, and paints the enemy as the one devoid of humanity. I want to thank my body and mind and soul for the flexibility and coherence, this coherence that allows me to write these words despite all this madness… I am proud and grateful for you. Yasmine Ayoub is a mental health professional at UPA – Gaza, Palestine. Story 18: November 13, 2023 While we are in the twilight zone between life and death, I find myself recalling my memories and remembering my life. Gaza… my pain and my beloved Gaza. The world knows of her five wars and a few aggressions. But we – her people – know that her wars are far more. You know her military wars, like a thirsty vampire attacking us collectively and one-by one to quench its thirst. Then it goes back to its nest, satiated with our remains, naps for a period of time called truce, which may be longer or shorter before the beast gets thirsty again and starts over… But we have another war that is no less vicious, operating in darkness like bats, war of the siege… We have been its game for 16-plus years, but – unlike other wars – it is slow and has its unique taste; it slowly counts our flesh, turning the kill into an art; flavours with different spices; chews slowly, then wipes its mouth, takes off its gloves and walks away, so that anyone looking – if someone actually investigates – finds no trace or evidence to condemn… Both wars are heavy with fear, worry, and helplessness, and make you ponder which of the two would end your life first… As a mental health specialist, I was destined to work with tens of children whose ages range between 6 and 17 years. All of them born in the era of the siege… I shall not talk to you about their pains, but rather about their dreams… – I dream to have a Barbie doll or any other toy, doesn’t matter which.
– I dream to have windows for the house because it gets very cold.
– I dream to take an allowance to school.
– I wish I could ride a car to school because the path is very long and the school bag is heavy.
– I wish to go to a restaurant just one time.
– To have meat on Friday like others.
– That we bring fruits to the house.
– A big shawarma sandwich.
– To live in a house instead of the wooden shack.
– I dream to wear new boots, for all my life I’ve worn used boots that outgrew the feet of others.
– To buy new clothes for Eid.
– To have a TV or mobile phone.
– LED light for the night because we are scared when the electricity is out. And this is only a drop in the sea… Their dreams are all about eating, drinking, clothing, and shelter. In a time where children of the world steadily rise up Maslow’s pyramid, most of us are glued to its base. This is no surprise since most people in Gaza fall below the poverty line… significantly below it, ladies and gentlemen… like the families of the unemployed, those with limited income, and those living in debt… and far and few are those to whom life has smiled by letting them crawl above the poverty line to afford those basics. Some of them are public employees or employees of the UNRWA or any of the international organisations… And there are families oscillating around that line, like families of daily laborers and workers on short-term contracts. Those climb above the line when they find a job, and flip back below it when their job ends… so even the slightest sense of security in income and basic livelihood is not present. My kids once had such simple dreams, for we, too, had limited income as I struggled to find a job. With patience and faith, and much persistence, ten years passed post graduation before I was able to find me a contract-based job. As if dreams grow in direct positive correlation with income, for today my children have “luxurious” dreams now that their mother is working, albeit intermittently. One of my girls dreams of owning a car, and another of riding a plane, at least once before she dies… Talking of travel, we have no right to it, for the borders of land and sky are sealed with rusty locks… you can ask our crossings how many men, women, and children have passed waiting for permission to leave for medical treatment, not for tourism or fun… As for the borders of the sea, thank God that they endowed upon us a few miles, from which some can find sustenance from fishing and some entertainment… that’s the only outlet for the poor, for its sand, air, and water are free. Did you feel some hope here? Hold on… for its wat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/books/mass-protest-decade-vincent-bevins-book-review,Books,Why the Mass Protest Decade of 2010-2020 Left Us with a ‘Missing Revolution’,"People on the streets crashing into a palace or the House of the People, then managing to transform ideas of participation, effect structural shifts in the meaning of democracy and accelerate travel times of pieces on the chess board of history, are as much truth, as fantasy. The French Revolution, 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917 the 1968 street in France and even the so-called ‘colour’ revolutions in Europe have got enough scrutiny from historians and political scientists to have sharpened our sense of when we must pay attention to people gathering at street corners. ‘If We Burn, The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution,’ Vincent Bevins, Public Affairs, an imprint of Hachette, October 2023. But it is our immediate past, the intense street protests we have witnessed across the globe, in this millennium, be it the ‘Arab Spring’, protests in Chile, Spain, Sudan, Indonesia, Greece or Occupy Wall Street, which remain a black box.  There have been few attempts to look at the full spectrum of protests unfolding across continents. Though studies, among others, like The Power of the Street: Evidence from Egypt’s Arab Spring by Daron Acemoglu, Tarek A. Hassan and Ahmed Tahoun and Zeynep Tufekci’s Twitter and Tear Gas – The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest are highly informative accounts but studies are often focussed on one, not looking at the many demonstrations that simultaneously burst forth between 2010 and 2020. Journalist and author Vincent Bevins, in his landmark new book, If We Burn, manages to draw our attention to street mobilisations which left us energised and exhausted, but also left a revolution-sized hole at the end of it.  Theorists and chroniclers who followed the ‘movements’ with interest and hope of course would have noticed the “missing revolution” left behind in the aftermath. But Bevins finds the “missing revolution” reason enough to go behind the fizz and the fury and ask difficult questions about why so little changed, if there was so much fervour, heat and noise. Starting in the period after World War II and the decolonisation that followed, Bevins focusses on new means of communication that offered a new way of articulating politics, they were careful to stay away from the framework of the ‘old left’, proud to call themselves the ‘new Left’. This was seen as horizontalist, non-hierarchical and more representative. This was a sharp contrast to what they saw as the old way of trying to usher in revolutions and change. A mix of the use of news media, staging demonstrations in the heart of the city, getting together the right kind of pamphlets and allowing those gathered to work their magic – rather than think through change with a vanguard at the helm of rallying masses. Bevins is a journalist and says at the outset that he is not a historian. But having “carried out over two hundred interviews in twelve countries, speaking with the people who created the street movements, many of the politicians who had to deal with them, and a lot of the people whose lives were affected” gives him considerable command over what was happening in the early years of the 21st century. He writes, “our conversations varied widely, but I attempted to orient them all around a few apparently naive, almost intentionally stupid questions: What led to the protest explosion? What were its goals? Were they achieved? If they weren’t achieved, why not?” Also read: Interview: On Our Capacity for Philosophy, Protests and Isolation The author acknowledges his debt to the frameworks of 1789 and 1917 which “have served as reference points for so much revolutionary practice, it is important to trace the ways that intellectual history on the left has shaped contemporary protest, even if the desires expressed in recent episodes have fallen all over the political spectrum.” The book throws up enough for readers to attempt an answer to the central question of why these eruptions on the street often had exactly the opposite effect as that intended by those at the barricades. Ask any tourist trying to look for the remains of Tahrir Square in Cairo or those making enquiries of the fruit seller more than a decade on in Tunisia, whose immolation led to events that spread like wildfire across the region. The Arab Spring was anything but, in hindsight. The central debate remains that of how much spontaneity and horizontalism can stand-in for discipline, pre-planning and a sense of what is to follow after the fall (should a fall be effected, in the first place).  If We Burn achieves its very difficult aim – quite like what Naomi Klein’s landmark No Logo did as the last millennium closed – of getting a grip over events spread across the globe with solid reportage. Like No Logo offered a brush with the disconcerting truth of what was happening with labour and big capital as the new economic order was turning into a global beast in the nineties, this book is essential reading. It has a reporter’s attention to detail as events were unfolding, combined with reflections from several protagonists, makers of movements and those impacted, people the author spoke to, long after the tide had subsided.   Disappointingly, India is excluded from the ambit of research, despite having experienced its own share of significant street turmoil over ‘corruption’ in 2011 and then in 2019-20 over questions of citizenship, then over the food economy. But the instances studied here offer many parallels to our situation. There is a case that even in 2023, we are too close to the slogans and the marches on the street to be able to judge what has only just gone by. Many would say, it is anything but over, eg., 1800 A.D. would not have been the best time to pass judgement on what events at the Bastille in 1789 were to mean for the world. Perhaps more time should be allowed to go by before we judge.  But If We Burn is more than a first draft of history. It offers unsettling propositions about the present we find ourselves in, and the prospects for change, and not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/government/pm-narendra-modi-congress-naxal-violence-union-government-data,Government,Modi Says Congress Failed To 'Control Naxal Violence’ – Union Government Data Shows Otherwise,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a rally in Chhattisgarh on Tuesday, November 7, that whenever the Congress comes to power, incidents of terrorism and Maoist violence increase and accused the grand old party of failing to contain Maoist violence in the poll-bound state. “Whenever Congress comes to power, the courage of terrorists and Naxalites increases in the country… The Congress government has failed to control Naxal violence,” he said at a rally in Bishrampur, Surajpur. “Wherever you see there is news of bombs going off in one place or the other, killings here and there. Such news would come. In whichever state the Congress is in power, crimes, loot and plunder rule. Congress has been unsuccessful in containing Naxal violence. In recent times several BJP workers have been taken away from us. A few days ago, one of our workers was shot dead,” he said. However, a look at the Union government’s own data on Maoist violence over the years belies Prime Minister Modi’s claims about Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh. In fact, Union home minister Amit Shah, during the campaign, noted the reduction in Maoist violence and gave credit to his party. MHA data shows reduction in Maoist violence  According to data available on the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) website, there has been a decline in the number of civilians killed by Left Wing Extremism (LWE) since 2010. Civilian deaths have fallen consistently over the past few years, from 722 in 2010 to 82 in 2022. Source: MHA In terms of attacks on economic infrastructures, the number of incidents or attacks also decreased since 2010, the same website shows. The attacks decreased from 365 in 2010 to 42 each in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Source: MHA Replies in parliament also note decline in LWE incidents In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha in the monsoon session that ended on August 11, the MHA stated that according to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, police and public order are with the state governments.  “However, to address Left Wing Extremism (LWE) menace holistically, Government of India (GoI) approved ‘National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE’ in 2015 envisaging a multi-pronged strategy involving security-related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. Steadfast implementation of this policy has resulted in consistent decline in LWE-related violence and its geographical spread,” said the written reply dated August 9, by MoS Home Nityanand Rai. Rai also provided a year-wise breakup of LWE incidents and deaths since 2018. 118** 63** Source: Reply in Rajya Sabha (August 9, 2023) *Incidents perpetrated by Left Wing Extremists **Incidents initiated by Security Forces In 2018, there were 833 incidents and 240 deaths in the country, followed by 670 incidents and 202 deaths in 2019, 665 incidents and 183 deaths in 2020, 509 incidents and 147 deaths in 2021. From 2022, the data shows the number of incidents perpetrated by LWEs and incidents initiated by the security forces. There were 413 incidents perpetrated by LWEs and 118 incidents initiated by security forces, while 98 deaths were recorded that year. In 2023 (till July 15), there were 273 incidents perpetrated by LWE and 63 incidents initiated by the security forces, along with 79 deaths. In response to a question by Chhattisgarh MP Deepak Baij, Rai said in a written reply in Lok Sabha on March 21 that there “has been significant improvement” in the LWE security situation in the country in the last five years. Rai also provided specific figures on Chhattisgarh that stated: Source: Written reply in Lok Sabha (March 21, 2023) Amit Shah claims credit for decline in Maoist violence While Modi said on Tuesday that incidents of Maoist violence have increased, last month addressing a rally in Jagdalpur, home minister Amit Shah said that Maoist incidents have declined in the last nine years. “In nine years of the Modi government, incidents of (Naxal) violence declined by 52%, deaths (in Maoist violence) came down by 70%, civilian deaths decreased by 68%, while the (number of) Naxal-affected districts declined by 62%,” he was quoted as saying. After chairing a review meeting of LWE with state chief ministers and top security officials on October 6, the MHA in a press release also gave similar figures. In an interview with The Wire, Baij, who is the Chhattisgarh Congress chief, accused the Union government of trying to take credit for the decline in Maoist incidents and pointed to contradictory statements by BJP leaders. “The Union government is trying to take credit for the good work done by the Chhattisgarh government. These are double standards in the Union government’s policies and this won’t work. Amit Shah says something, [BJP president J.P.] Nadda says something else. Different leaders are saying different things and they are not on the same page on this [matter] either. But the Chhattisgarh government has done good work and there is peace in Bastar,” he said. In February, Nadda – like Modi – claimed that Naxal activities had increased in Chhattisgarh under the Congress government. Amit Shah at Muzaffarpur. Photo: X/@AmitShah Union government’s role in controlling LWE According to the MHA’s division to tackle LWE, which was created in 2006, the Union government’s role is to deal with it in a “holistic manner” while the primary responsibility lies with state governments. “In dealing with this decades-old problem, it has been felt appropriate, after various high-level deliberations and interactions with the State Governments concerned, that an integrated approach aimed at the relatively more affected areas would deliver results. With this in view, a detailed analysis of the spread and trends in respect of Left Wing Extremist violence has been made and 70 districts in ten States have been taken up for special attention with regard to planning, implementation and monitoring various interventions. However, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ being State subjects, action on maintenance of law and order, lies primarily in the domain of the State Governments. The Central Government closely monitors the situation and supplements and coordinates their efforts in several ways,” it says. These efforts include providing the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs); sanction of India Reserve (IR) battalions; setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) schools; modernisation and upgradation of the State Police and their Intelligence apparatus; reimbursement of security-related expenditure under the Security-related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme; providing helicopters, training, sharing intelligence, facilitating inter-state coordination, etc.  “The underlying philosophy is to enhance the capacity of the State Governments to tackle the Maoist menace in a concerted manner,” it says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eman Abu Shawish is a mental health practitioner at UPA, Gaza, Palestine. Story 19: November 15, 2023 The Smell of Gunpowder: There are two kinds of killing we are exposed to daily and always from this criminal usurper. The first is direct killing, using the strongest, most destructive types of missiles in the world. Those can annihilate and kill laaaaarge numbers of people, surpassing 100 per hit, typically of women, children, and the elderly. As for the second, it is a slow death for those who live day-by-day in this ugly war. This is primarily through destroying every civil resource like municipal services, which led to piling of garbage in neighbourhoods, especially with the large numbers of the internally displaced gathering in those neighbourhoods. This increases pollution on many levels, insect infestations, rats, foul smells, and air pollution. What is more difficult is that the usurper uses the direction of the wind as a weapon, especially at night. They shoot toxic smoke and internationally banned phosphorous bombs. The toxins move with the wind between neighbourhoods and into homes. Frequently, those toxins are accompanied by a strong, foul odour that smells much like gunpowder, and gives us a feeling of death by suffocation. I remember the early morning breeze as cool and refreshing, expanding your chest with joy. I used to long to smell the dew drops and begin my day on that note… especially on days I planned to play football (soccer). But this foul smell increases by sunrise, robbing us of the nature’s simple gift of clean air… My 75-year-old father cannot stand this suffocating smell, and coughs and sneezes for a long time. Our heart sinks of fear for his health each time this happens. Then he confesses: “I have lived through maaany wars in my life but have never witnessed anything like this war and this brutality. I cannot bear this.” So do children. They are deeply impacted for they cough even when sleeping, as if they have a heavy flu. My 7-year-old daughter always says: “Daddy, my nose is blocked and I can’t breathe. I wish I can have some good air!” Where do I get my daughter some good air… I hold her and stay silent. We started thinking about simple solutions for this problem, so we soaked pieces of cloth in water, which itself is scarce. When we smell those toxins, we cover our noses and try to breathe slowly until the smoke subsides. My wife looks at me, tearful from all the smoke and gunpowder, and wonders: “Is it our destiney to die by suffocation?” A lot of people say that if we make it alive, we will probably die by diseases resulting from these toxins. As if the occupiers have planned a never ending series of death to extract all hope of life, even after this war is over. We have God, for He is our agent.

https://thewire.in/world/sympathy-for-israel-has-evaporated-all-eyes-are-on-ceasefire-now,World,"Sympathy for Israel Has Evaporated, All Eyes Are on Ceasefire Now","We can expect a ceasefire in Gaza in the next ‘several days’. In an interview with Karan Thapar on The Wire, Dr. Musa Abu Marzouq, the head of international relations of Hamas, speaking from Doha, disclosed that there could be a ceasefire for 5 days accompanied with an an exchange of hostages between Hamas and Israel. It was followed by a report in Washington Post that Israel is considering stopping its assault on Gaza for 5 days. As part of the deal, Hamas will probably release 50 Israelis who were taken hostage by its fighters in their attack October 7 attack and it is possible that Israel may release some Palestinians in its prisons. It was not clear from the Washington Post report whether Israel is ready to release some of the Palestinians – held in its prisons for years – in exchange for these hostages which include 147 children. If the condition of Hamas is fulfilled, the ill-fated Palestinians held illegally by Israel can feel liberty. We must note that the very world which is demanding the release of the Israeli hostages never felt it necessary to ask Israel to release the Palestinians it keeps capturing and imprisoning frequently. It is also an interesting irony that the Palestinians in Israeli jails are considered arrests and legal in a way, but the Israelis who are in the custody of Hamas are called hostages, which has no legal sanction. That is why the whole world is against Hamas. It considers this act unacceptable but thinks Israel has a right to arrest Palestinians. So there is international pressure for the release of Israelis but the freedom of Palestinian prisoners is not an issue for the international community. They are destined to languish in the Israeli jails, unheard and unseen. A Jewish protester in a pro-Palestine demonstration in the US. Representative image. Photo: X/@jvplive Only Hamas is raising its voice for their release. But its words are considered offensive since it has been declared a terrorist organisation by the international community. But if no one else speaks for the Palestinians, then should the Palestinians not listen to Hamas just because it has been declared ‘terrorist’ by the powerful of the world? It is not yet clear whether the Palestinians will be released or not. Then why is Hamas ready for this ceasefire? Because it is important for the people of Gaza to survive. It is necessary for them to get water, electricity, gas, and access to internet. It is necessary to treat the injured Palestinians left behind among the 13,000 that are dead. It is important for people to get food and water. Every minute of absence of firing or bombing means a life saved, a limb still attached to the body it belongs to. And the governments of the power wielding world would not allow it as they have closed ranks behind Israel. The allegation against Hamas is that it was not concerned about the well-being of the people of Gaza. Why else would it have attacked Israel on October 7? Did it not know how Israel would react? I found this question very interesting. Implicit in this question is the assumption that Israel is a bully and you should not do anything even if it is beating you daily, looting your houses and land. And that you do not expect a measured response from it to any crisis. That it would indiscriminately wreak vengeance on everyone it thinks Hamas represents. But now if Hamas is ready to go the extra mile to stop the violence, then the reason behind this decision is its concern for the people of Gaza. Also read: Palestine, Palestinians and the Western Liberal’s Burden Till just a day ago, not only Israel, but also the governments of its patron states like the US, England, Canada and Germany were not in favour of stopping violence against the people of Gaza. Why are they now eager for it? They were after all not averse to killing children, attacking hospitals and UN facilities, destroying Gaza. Remember US President Joe Biden’s callous response  to the question about ceasefire? He had smugly responded : ‘No. Not possible.’ So what has changed? If this decision of ceasefire is taken, then its credit belongs to the American and European youth that has not left the streets since the Israeli attack and have continued to put pressure on their governments to ask Israel to go for a ceasefire. Lakhs of youngsters – in London, New York, Toronto and Berlin, and scores of other big and small cities across the US and other wester countries –  carrying Palestinian flags, have been demonstrating against the Israeli attack. They are blocking railway stations, bridges, and intersections. Protesters took over the stage of a Democratic Party convention in the USA. They are protesting against their Democrat delegates for not advocating for a ceasefire. Same is the situation in England where the voters of the liberal Labour Party are protesting against their representatives. This worldwide revolt of the people, especially the young, against their governments is responsible for this move towards a ceasefire. About 150 citizens gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to protest Israeli atrocities in Palestine. Photo: Rohit Kumar The government in the US, which is working under the pressure of the Israeli lobby, is becoming more and more unpopular by each passing day because of its support for Israel’s genocidal violence. Public opinion is growing against Biden, who is seeking re-election in the next presidential election. With international public opinion being in favour of justice for Palestine, it is now becoming increasingly difficult for Israel to continue its killing spree. Thousands of people in Israel itself are protesting against the government. Jews and Arabs together. A long march has just reached Jerusalem. Many Israeli women are saying that the Israeli government does not care about the Israelis arrested by Hamas. The indiscriminate bombing of Gaza could put the hostages at risk, but the government is not even thinking about it. The Israeli government and Netanyahu are rapidly losing public support within their country. Netanyahu also understands that the wave of sympathy that had arisen in favor of Israel after the Hamas attack of October 7, is now turning against it after its brutal bombing of Gaza and its sadistic destruction for the last 44 days. The images of murdered, limbless children, of little bodies packed in body bags, arouse repulsion, hatred, and anger against Israel. Netanyahu, who till a day ago had balked at any proposal for a ceasefire is now under tremendous pressure from his patron governments as they fear that any delay will turn world opinion against them and Israel. But the reality is that the tide has already turned against them. Support for Palestine in Market Street, SF, CA. Photo: Tinou Bao It is impossible for the world to remain silent on Israel’s violence after watching Gaza turning into rubble, children being shot directly, hospitals being bombed and ICU patients dying on TV. The world is speaking. As days pass, it is becoming clear that Israel’s intention is not to teach a lesson to Hamas but that it wants completely cleanse Gaza of Palestinians and capture it. This is an expansionist war. It is now becoming impossible even for Israel’s supporters to justify the destruction of the al-Shifa hospital by Israel. Israel has not yet been able to prove its claim that the hospital was the command and control centre of Hamas. The video evidence it has released to prove its claim is not trusted even by the media platforms sympathetic to it, such as BBC and New York Times or CNN. Even they are not able to digest the laughable, edited videos presented to them by Israel. They have been forced to say that till now Israel has not been able to present solid evidence that the hospital was being used by Hamas. Yet it has turned the hospital into debris. Not only al-Shifa, it has destroyed other hospitals as well. As I write this, the news is that Israel has bombed UN-run schools and killed more than 200 people. After repeatedly saying that it is searching for Hamas which  is hiding among the civilians in northern Gaza and hence it has no choice but to kill them all, Israel is now saying that Hamas is in southern Gaza. Earlier Israel was asking Palestinians to move to South Gaza for safety. Now it is taking them to vacate it. Then where should the people of Gaza go? Also read: In IDFA Award Acceptance Speech, Anand Patwardhan Calls For ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ and ‘Just Peace’ In response, Israel  shamelessly says that it is not its problem. It just wants Gaza to turn into a parking lot free of its people. The way it is planting its flag on hospitals and cemeteries, and flattened land, on the hillocks of rubble and ruins of Gaza, it is clear that it only wants to expand its territory. After watching all this, how can one continue its support to Israel? A large number of Jews have joined protests against the violence of Israel. Their visible presence makes it difficult to dismiss all opposition by calling it anti-semitic. People hear the Israeli ministers and leaders when they say that they want all the Palestinians to be driven out of Gaza and not to return even after the war. Its leaders shamelessly ask as to why other countries cannot absorb them. The people of the world understand well the evil intent of Israel to eliminate Palestinians and have risen against it and their governments for their heartless support to the criminal Israel. So it is neither the humanity of Biden or other prime ministers of the west, nor the kindness of Netanyahu that they are thinking of stopping the violence for five days.This is a desperate attempt to save ground for Israel. Whatever be the  reason, it is necessary to stop Israeli violence as soon as possible. Why this is important can be understood today by reading a post by a Palestinian: ’36 people from my family were killed yesterday. If the war had stopped yesterday, they would have been alive.’ This is the story of every family in Gaza. One in every 200 people has been killed. Every minute someone is being killed. A child is being murdered every 10 minutes. It is difficult to carry on the business of the world with the burden of this genocide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/south-asia/social-media-breathing-new-life-bhutan-unwritten-local-languages,South Asia,How Social Media Is Breathing New Life Into Bhutan’s Unwritten Local Languages,"Dechen, 40, grew up in Thimphu, the capital city of Bhutan. Her native language was Mangdip, also known as Nyenkha, as her parents are originally from central Bhutan. She went to schools in the city, where the curriculum was predominantly taught in Dzongkha, the national language, and English. In Dechen’s house, everyone spoke Dzongkha. She only spoke her mother tongue when she had guests from her village, who could not understand Dzongkha and during her occasional visits to her village nestled in the mountains. Her mother tongue knowledge was limited. However, things have now changed. With 90% of Bhutanese people using social media and social media penetrating all remote areas in Bhutan, Dechen’s relatives in remote villages are connected on WeChat. She is in three WeChat groups where people usually communicate through voice messages in their native language. Most WeChat users in rural parts of the country communicate in their oral native language. “I learn many words. I learnt how to say a lot of things in my own language,” the mother of two now living in Western Australia told me. Dechen’s story is not isolated. Social media is giving a new lifeline to Bhutan’s native languages, which do not have written script and lack proper documentation. By communicating through voice messages, social media is giving Bhutanese people in both urban and rural areas a new opportunity to use their local language. Losing Bhutan’s languages Bhutan is a tiny Himalayan nation with a population of under 800,000 people. Internet and television was introduced only in 1999 and mobile phones in 2004. The country has more than 20 local languages, but only Dzongkha has written text and is promoted as the national language. The country struggles to promote the national language and its usage against English. Today most urban residents, especially the elites, speak English as their primary language. Many languages – especially minority languages – are vanishing or becoming endangered as younger generations switch to Dzongkha and English. The medium of instruction in schools is mostly in English; Dzongkha is taught only as grammar and literature. Students are shamed and often punished for using their local languages. The preservation and promotion of local languages, therefore, depends on the speakers. A language faces extinction when its speakers die out or switch to another language. Linguist Pema Wangdi has researched languages in Bhutan, and he told me many people are losing their native language. “When we lose our language, we lose a piece of our national identity,” he told me. Wangdi has identified there are no longer any speakers of Olekha, an indigenous dialect of Rukha in Wangdu Phodrang. “The loss of a single language is a loss of a piece of our national linguistic heritage and identity,” he said. “When a language is lost, cultural traditions which are tied to that language such as songs, myths and poetry will be lost forever.” Other Bhutanese languages – including Tshophu language of Doyaps in Samtse, Monpa language of central Bhutan, and Gongdukha of Mongar – are endangered and at the brink of extinction. Preservation of local languages The future of minority languages is under threat. The Constitution of Bhutan mandates the preservation and promotion of local languages, but there are no official efforts to preserve native languages. But encouraging people to speak their native languages can have far-reaching benefits in preserving and promoting Bhutan’s rich culture and tradition. Language embodies identity, ethnicity and cultural values: a thriving local language would help transfer this intangible wealth to the younger generation. Social media could be an invaluable tool in this preservation. Bhutan could save its languages from becoming extinct with promotion of social media usage and language education could be done on social media platforms. With both young and old people glued to social media, encouraging more people to use local languages in social media could generate interest among the youth to learn their local languages. It could also help in documenting the endangered local languages as the older generation can record their voices on WeChat. Many elder citizens feel strongly about their language and emphasise teaching their mother tongue to the younger generation and their grandchildren. Social media – joining the younger generation on platforms where they feel at home – could be the way forward. Tashi Dema, PhD candidate in language and politics, University of New England.

https://thewire.in/books/mass-protest-decade-vincent-bevins-book-review,Books,Why the Mass Protest Decade of 2010-2020 Left Us with a ‘Missing Revolution’,"People on the streets crashing into a palace or the House of the People, then managing to transform ideas of participation, effect structural shifts in the meaning of democracy and accelerate travel times of pieces on the chess board of history, are as much truth, as fantasy. The French Revolution, 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917 the 1968 street in France and even the so-called ‘colour’ revolutions in Europe have got enough scrutiny from historians and political scientists to have sharpened our sense of when we must pay attention to people gathering at street corners. ‘If We Burn, The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution,’ Vincent Bevins, Public Affairs, an imprint of Hachette, October 2023. But it is our immediate past, the intense street protests we have witnessed across the globe, in this millennium, be it the ‘Arab Spring’, protests in Chile, Spain, Sudan, Indonesia, Greece or Occupy Wall Street, which remain a black box.  There have been few attempts to look at the full spectrum of protests unfolding across continents. Though studies, among others, like The Power of the Street: Evidence from Egypt’s Arab Spring by Daron Acemoglu, Tarek A. Hassan and Ahmed Tahoun and Zeynep Tufekci’s Twitter and Tear Gas – The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest are highly informative accounts but studies are often focussed on one, not looking at the many demonstrations that simultaneously burst forth between 2010 and 2020. Journalist and author Vincent Bevins, in his landmark new book, If We Burn, manages to draw our attention to street mobilisations which left us energised and exhausted, but also left a revolution-sized hole at the end of it.  Theorists and chroniclers who followed the ‘movements’ with interest and hope of course would have noticed the “missing revolution” left behind in the aftermath. But Bevins finds the “missing revolution” reason enough to go behind the fizz and the fury and ask difficult questions about why so little changed, if there was so much fervour, heat and noise. Starting in the period after World War II and the decolonisation that followed, Bevins focusses on new means of communication that offered a new way of articulating politics, they were careful to stay away from the framework of the ‘old left’, proud to call themselves the ‘new Left’. This was seen as horizontalist, non-hierarchical and more representative. This was a sharp contrast to what they saw as the old way of trying to usher in revolutions and change. A mix of the use of news media, staging demonstrations in the heart of the city, getting together the right kind of pamphlets and allowing those gathered to work their magic – rather than think through change with a vanguard at the helm of rallying masses. Bevins is a journalist and says at the outset that he is not a historian. But having “carried out over two hundred interviews in twelve countries, speaking with the people who created the street movements, many of the politicians who had to deal with them, and a lot of the people whose lives were affected” gives him considerable command over what was happening in the early years of the 21st century. He writes, “our conversations varied widely, but I attempted to orient them all around a few apparently naive, almost intentionally stupid questions: What led to the protest explosion? What were its goals? Were they achieved? If they weren’t achieved, why not?” Also read: Interview: On Our Capacity for Philosophy, Protests and Isolation The author acknowledges his debt to the frameworks of 1789 and 1917 which “have served as reference points for so much revolutionary practice, it is important to trace the ways that intellectual history on the left has shaped contemporary protest, even if the desires expressed in recent episodes have fallen all over the political spectrum.” The book throws up enough for readers to attempt an answer to the central question of why these eruptions on the street often had exactly the opposite effect as that intended by those at the barricades. Ask any tourist trying to look for the remains of Tahrir Square in Cairo or those making enquiries of the fruit seller more than a decade on in Tunisia, whose immolation led to events that spread like wildfire across the region. The Arab Spring was anything but, in hindsight. The central debate remains that of how much spontaneity and horizontalism can stand-in for discipline, pre-planning and a sense of what is to follow after the fall (should a fall be effected, in the first place).  If We Burn achieves its very difficult aim – quite like what Naomi Klein’s landmark No Logo did as the last millennium closed – of getting a grip over events spread across the globe with solid reportage. Like No Logo offered a brush with the disconcerting truth of what was happening with labour and big capital as the new economic order was turning into a global beast in the nineties, this book is essential reading. It has a reporter’s attention to detail as events were unfolding, combined with reflections from several protagonists, makers of movements and those impacted, people the author spoke to, long after the tide had subsided.   Disappointingly, India is excluded from the ambit of research, despite having experienced its own share of significant street turmoil over ‘corruption’ in 2011 and then in 2019-20 over questions of citizenship, then over the food economy. But the instances studied here offer many parallels to our situation. There is a case that even in 2023, we are too close to the slogans and the marches on the street to be able to judge what has only just gone by. Many would say, it is anything but over, eg., 1800 A.D. would not have been the best time to pass judgement on what events at the Bastille in 1789 were to mean for the world. Perhaps more time should be allowed to go by before we judge.  But If We Burn is more than a first draft of history. It offers unsettling propositions about the present we find ourselves in, and the prospects for change, and not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/political-economy/how-neo-nationalism-has-fuelled-the-transformation-of-old-welfare-state-to-new-capital-state,Political Economy,How Neo-Nationalism Has Fuelled the Transformation of Old Welfare-State to New Capital-State,"This is a two-part review analysis based on the key findings in Oleksandr Svitych’s recent book, The Rise of the Capital-State and Neo-Nationalism, which attempts to provide a political economy approach to the rise of ‘neo-nationalism’ – a populist form of nationalism observed in the contemporary globalised period.  “Populism is an ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, the ‘pure people’ versus the ‘corrupt elite’, and which argues that politics should be an expression of the general will of the people.” – Mudde (2004) With these words, political economist Oleksandr Svitych, in a recent book The Rise of the Capital-State and Neo-Nationalism, attempts to provide an approach to neo-nationalism from the perspective of political economy. This is the populist form of nationalism observed in the contemporary globalised period. Neo-nationalism, by Svitych, is defined as an “assertive identity-maintenance project at the intersection of nationalism, populism, and radicalism.” The socio-economic and socio-political ruptures observed from the interplay of these phenomena re-transforms state-society-economy relations, which according to the author, require an empirical, context-dependent analysis. The Rise of the Capital-state and Neo-Nationalism by Oleksandr Svitych (Brill, November 2022) Even though the main country-based case studies identified in Svitych’s thesis remains restricted to four OECD countries, namely Hungary, Australia, France, and South Korea, the analytical and theoretical contributions from his book’s thesis, and the use of Polanyi’s work, establish an inextricable link between discontented experiments of free market reforms, declining state legitimacy, and identity-based mobilisation, which has been defining the nature of geopolitics across the globe. Most studies on the contested phenomenon of populism, including the book titled Strongmen Saviours…, have tried to study the “demand side” or the “supply side” reasons or causes for the electoral success of neo-nationalist leaders, and their respective political parties. The rise of neo-nationalism across nations from both the developed Global North (from the US to France) and developing Global South (from India to Brazil to Turkey) is observed in different contexts. These are rising unemployment, inequality, weakening labour power, an inefficient functioning of a corrupt bureaucratic state, triggering anti-establishment sentiments, and the role of cultural grievances, perceived ethnic threat, increase in immigration. Conceptualising populism as a thin-centered ideology driven by nationalist appeals allows to trace such important ideological shifts, according to Svitych. Labelling these shifts as “radical right” or “right-wing populism” conceptually offers a limiting view. There are more underlying factors shaping these shifts. Oleksandr interprets neo-nationalism as a “societal reaction against the capital state – a polity safeguarding the market order under the auspices of neoliberal globalisation, whereby, three clusters of institutional developments exhibit this uncoupling of the state from society: privatisation and individuation of the provisions for health, education, and welfare; precarisation of work and the weakening power of labour; and financialisation of the economy that redistributed wealth to the top”. The book’s thesis makes an important observation in the context of seeing the rise of neo-nationalism/populism as a process of transforming the ‘welfare state’ into a ‘new capital state’. The author defines ‘new capital state’ as the latest paradigm of state development, distinguished by intensive commodification that favours the interests of capital over public ones. However, there is a slight disagreement with author Svitych. Also read: The Flipside of Neo-Nationalism This observation might be partially true for most of the OECD-based case studies cited by Svitych in his book, but in context of scenarios emerging from different countries of the developing global South, say, India or Turkey, which have seen their own tryst with the rise of right-wing populism, they provide a slightly differed ‘transformation’. In this case, the old-welfare state has not necessarily given way to a new capital state system. Moreover, it has also seen a ‘new form of populist-welfarism’ making any such analysis less linear, from what Svitych argues. For example, in the Indian context, under the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi, there is congruence between a significant transformation in the application of the new capital state, which Oleksandr speaks of, and the redistributive welfare state. In this scenario, the prime minister’s own name and central government funds are used for the direct delivery of welfare services (or public goods) amidst targeted beneficiaries and the poor for populist-electoral gains. It’s noteworthy to observe how the prime minister, just before the upcoming state assembly elections, announced, in rallies across Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the government’s plan to extend the ‘free-ration’ PMGKAY programme by another five years. The programme, introduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown, seeks to offer ration to 80 crore poorer beneficiaries across India. It was a key factor in allowing critical electoral support for the BJP in the last state assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. The missing wood from the trees Another set of key points deserving further exploration in Oleksandr’s work pertains to the operational behavior of other neo-nationalist regimes. This centers on the observed ‘change’ in the everyday political ethics embraced by the citizenry, especially those in unquestioning, blind support of a populist leader or regime. It is important to highlight how a persistent rise in Modi’s own popularity – and his consolidation of power across the nation, from one national election to another – was accentuated by the emotive politics of andha-vishwas weaponised through a rhetorical narrative push, using tools of information technology and state-propagandist media. This could be understood in the context of the rise of the political right, and the Modi-Shah regime’s complex experiments with the everyday political ethics of being built around the tradecraft of seducing the emotive majority. In his recent work on Indian neo-nationalism’s rise under Modi, Ajay Gudavarthy wrote about an interesting aspect, as reviewed earlier, of viewing the ‘emotive’ influence of Modi’s popularity amongst the larger Indian electorate, especially the Hindi-belt, despite the nature of social or economic issues that afflict the same majority. This is established by understanding that the right invests in morality, and what a majority works with is everyday ethics. Also read: The Political Ethics of the Indian Political Right Beyond that, the everyday ethics of being and what may help explain the average Hindu voter’s motivational rationality can be studied by viewing the application of Dharma, Dharam, Kama, Karma in the way these influence one’s daily life, in terms of motivation and cultural propriety. The Brahmanical cloak, originally intended to provide guidance, has become deeply politicised by the current regime led by Modi-Shah and [indirectly] the RSS. In their pursuit of establishing a Hindu Rashtra, there is a concerted effort to influence these symbols for the ’emotive (Hindu) majority’ to take pride in themselves or to assert majoritarian victimhood, as projected by Modi in his representation of both self and the nation. The role of Hindutva in defining the nature of faith and applied religious discourse for one to practice its majoritarian belief and assertion by ‘Cleaning India’, ‘teaching minorities a lesson, ‘establishing masculine muscularity in a hyper-nationalist wave’, is all part of a political project that builds itself on a new morality, ethics of being for emotions (rage, anger, violence) to be experienced and realised. On technology, conservatism in belief systems, and their role in neo-nationalism As per the new capital-state theory put forth by Svitych, neo-nationalism unfolds as a protective counter-movement against the erosion of old economic and social structures, creating another iteration of Polanyi’s “double-movement” dynamic. The rise of the capital-state, therefore, and the subsequent economic, social, and political discontent gave rise to counter-movements of both the Left and the Right form of neo-nationalism waves. There is surely agreement here, and the author’s analytical observations remain consistent with some of the non-western ‘neo-nationalist’ cases too. Neoliberal, supply-side economic policies, which accentuate inequality and dismantle the fundamental social and economic protections of a welfarist state, have, in many nations, given rise to or produced neo-nationalism through the emergence of the new capital state. The outcome of these processes could be seen in the strengthening of ethnic-nationalist sources of collective identity, for instance, Hindutva in India’s case; Orthodox Islam in Turkey; Evangelical Christian beliefs in Brazil and the US, for shaping right-wing populism, and a revival of civic-based values to reassert national identity through a class-based narrative, allowing for left-wing populist movements. However, the normative axis of the book misses a robust critique of ‘liberal foundations’ and principles that may be less relevant in the context of Indian polity or society. Another empirical gap in the book’s thesis, which stems from a normative void, is the weak link established between the actions of the political Right in ‘narrativizing’ an alternative ‘truth’. This addresses the emotive majority’s desire to immortalise acquired knowledge of the past in the pursuit of discovering a ‘new’ truth. The book falls short in fully exploring this dynamic, particularly in understanding it as part of the complex techno-political relationship the Right shares with contemporary tools and mechanisms of the current information order, such as digital technological infrastructure, which the Right effectively weaponises on a day-to-day basis. The rise of conservative religious-moral belief systems has been a key contributing factor in driving neo-nationalist movements, particularly in the context of contemporary political drive of populism in developing nations such as India, Turkey, and Brazil. The normative vision and ideas of conservative ethics or morality are channelled through new forms of symbolism, manipulated through media and information flow. This dynamic is particularly crucial for the Modi-Shah double engine in India, not only in the acquisition and centralisation of power but also in its consolidation through emotive narrativisation over the last decade. The media – much like other pillars –  have been weaponised for this neo-nationalism project which warrants further scrutiny. The next article builds the thesis of neo-nationalism’s causal linkage, and its effect, with different determining factors, particularly in the context of nations identified outside the scope of Olenksadr’s work, which focuses on four selected OECD nations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As per official sources, external affairs minister S. Jaishankar will represent India at the meeting convened by South Africa, the current chair of the group. Modi is the middle of a campaign blitzkrieg in the state of Rajasthan, which goes to the polls on November 25. He is scheduled to address three campaign rallies on Tuesday. South Africa’s foreign ministry issued a statement on Monday that President Cyril Ramaphosa had convened an “Extraordinary Joint Meeting on the Middle East situation” on November 21. “Leaders of BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – will join the virtual Extraordinary Meeting with invited BRICS leaders of Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates,” said the press release.  The UN secretary general Antonio Guterres will also take part in the meeting. A joint statement will be issued at the end of the summit, as per the South African foreign ministry. The Kremlin confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin will be participating at the virtual meeting. He had skipped the BRICS summit held in Johannesburg earlier this year which invited six new countries to join the grouping. President Xi Jinping is also set to participate in the BRICS meeting, as announced by the Chinese foreign ministry. Among the BRICS members, both old and new, India and Ethiopia were the only two to abstain in the voting for the UN General Assembly Resolution that called for humanitarian pause to allow for supply of food, fuel and water to the Gaza Strip. All the other members had voted in favour. On October 7, Hamas launched a terror attack from Gaza strip into southern Israel and killed more than 1,400 people. Since then, Israel launched counter-strikes into Gaza which has left more than 14,000 people dead, as per last official count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/video/watch-israel-hamas-lionel-barber-karan-thapar,Video,Watch | Israel Has Not Come Anywhere Near Its Goal of Eradicating Hamas: Former FT Editor,"In a broad and wide-ranging interview to explain how the West views the continuing Israel-Hamas war, now in its seventh week, a former long-serving editor of the Financial Times has said Israel “hasn’t come anywhere near its goal of eradicating Hamas”. Lionel Barber was replying to a specific question about what he believes Israel has achieved during the 40+ days of the war. In a 30-minute interview with Karan Thapar for The Wire, Barber said Israel’s campaign against Hamas has “polarised the world” adding it has done “a lot of damage” to Israel’s international image, particularly among the younger population of the West.  In the interview, Barber says he believes Israel will continue with its campaign against Hamas for, at least, a couple of more weeks because, as he put it, “the Israeli military hasn’t achieved its goal of eradicating Hamas”. Asked what he thinks will be history’s verdict on Benjamin Netanyahu’s prime ministership, Barber began by saying “it might have been quite generous” but, like many others, Netanyahu has stayed on for too long. Now, Barber added, he will be blamed for “the political, the intelligence and the military failure” of October 7. Barber explains how the Western perspective on the Israel-Hamas war differs from the one Indians are more familiar with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/world/gaza-urgency-war-crime-prosecutions,World,Gaza: The Urgency of War Crimes Prosecutions,"Israel’s mass murder in Gaza, part of the Palestinian homeland, is unique and permits none of the distraction of comparison with other crimes against humanity. Global civil society is aware of this and recognises that silence is complicity. Governments have either remained paralysed by indecision or joined the chorus of acclaim for Israel. Civil society for all its global reach in the campaign for Palestinian rights, is yet to make a dent in the undeclared alliance of power against the popular will. Except for a handful that broke off diplomatic contacts, governments are powerless because the US from its self-assigned perch as arbiter of neo-colonialist global law, is unequivocal in support of Israel. A month into the bombardment of Palestinian life, US President Joe Biden was asked about the possibilities of a ceasefire. “None, no possibility,” he deadpanned. A pause could perhaps be mandated, but only to secure the release of the captives taken by Palestinian militants in their audacious October 7 raid into southern settlements in Israel. Now an active patron of two wars in distinct theatres – aside from low-level conflicts across the globe the US plays sides in – Biden is unabashed about his double standards. His special assistant in the National Security Council, John Kirby was weepy and maudlin on live TV when speaking of civilian suffering in Ukraine, as also the casualties Israel suffered on October 7. About civilian casualties among the Palestinians, he was brusque and business-like. The US would lay down no “red lines” for Israel’s operations, Kirby said, a response reminiscent of the “stuff happens” comment from US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld (as he then was) after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and that country’s descent into blood mayhem.  Biden visited Israel ten days into the conflict. The Al Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza had just been bombed, and his response was a sporting metaphor: “based on what I’ve seen, the other team must have done it, not you”, he said sitting across from Israel’s far-right Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Dissembling was the theme after his return home, when he brushed off the toll of deaths and injuries put out by Gaza’s health ministry as implausible.  Biden emboldened further outrages. In the days that followed, Israel attacked every healthcare facility in Gaza, ambulance convoys, schools, mosques and churches, with lethal force. The repeated bombardment of refugee camps under the UN administration was called out as a war crime, but this unequivocal finding by observers on the ground gained no official endorsement from global watchdog bodies such as the International Criminal Court or the UN Security Council. On November 13, the Israeli army’s spokesman took embedded reporters on a tour of the bombed-out shell of the Rantisi Hospital in Gaza. He pointed to a chalkboard written in Arabic, alleging it was a duty roster for the militant resistance organisation Hamas. The claim was debunked at first glance: the chalkboard did nothing more sinister than list the days of the week in the Arabic script. The following day, when Israel’s invasion force stepped up the ferocity of its attack on the Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest health facility and the last to retain a level of serviceability, it claimed to be carrying out a “precise and targeted” operation against armed Hamas fighters sheltering behind the protection afforded by the hospital. The US asserted that it had evidence proving the Israeli case. No third party stepped up to endorse the claim, neither was any allowed in to verify. The Israeli onslaught went on regardless. What would be the obligations of global watchdog bodies, which have shown great alacrity in bringing indictments against soft targets? There is a framework of legal obligations global players are expected to honour, a crystallisation of the learning experiences of the “civilised West” after it dragged the world through two rounds of industrial-scale bloodshed in the first half of the 20th century. These were embedded in the Geneva Conventions and related global covenants. The fourth of the Geneva Conventions (GCIV) and the First Additional Protocol are of particular relevance, since they deal with the protection of civilians in armed conflict.  Al Shifa hospital is being used as shelter for displaced families in Gaza. Photo: WHO Among the rules applicable in all forms of conflict, irrespective of the status of belligerents as state or non-state actors, is Article 33 of the GCIV, which prohibits “collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or terrorism”. This is followed by an entire section on “Occupied Territories” with no fewer than fifteen articles. Among these is one (Article 55), which makes it the duty of the Occupying Power to ensure “the food and medical supplies of the population”, and in particular, to “bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate”. Immediately afterwards is the stipulation (Article 56), that the maintenance of “medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory” is an obligation of the Occupying Power, “with the co-operation of national and local authorities”.  Israel has in the past, argued that it is not bound by the Geneva Conventions in any of the occupied territories because there was no sovereign power supplanted by its military conquest. Military lines of control were drawn at Gaza and the West Bank in 1948, after hostilities between Israel and the Egyptian and Jordanian armies ended. Israel merely replaced one form of military administration with another in 1967, when it rolled into Gaza and the West Bank after blitzing the Arab armies in the Six-Day War. This perspective has been rejected by every expert body since the language of the Geneva Conventions creates no such distinction. Its protections rather, are extended to all persons who “at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals”. Israel has since added another element to its ideological armament, with the claim that after its withdrawal of all military deployments and settlements in 2004, the situation in Gaza ceased to be one of occupation, since it is no longer in “effective control”. The reality is that Israel has absolute control over all routes of access to the strip through air, land and sea, has maintained a powerful military presence at Gaza’s border with Egypt, and repeatedly intervened by military means, massively and at times of its choosing. In 2007, it fomented a series of pitched battles between Hamas and the rival resistance group Fatah, in an effort to overturn the result of the Palestinian National Council election of 2006, which the former had won. Effectively splitting the two and confining Hamas to Gaza, Israel ratcheted up the severity of its blockade of the territory.  Israel justifies the blockade on the grounds that it is engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas. In 2010, when a Turkish ship bringing essential food and medicines approached Gaza’s shores, it was interdicted by an Israeli naval task force. Commandos forcibly boarded the ship and killed nine peace volunteers, claiming the alibi that they met with violent resistance. Israel argued before a formal inquest that it was in a state of war with Gaza which made its blockade legal and its interdiction of the Turkish ship a permitted action. The GCIV stipulates that warring parties will not use deprivation of the basic necessities of civilian life as a weapon of war. Article 23 requires all contracting parties to “allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital stores, … essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant mothers and maternity cases”. Article 70 of the First Additional Protocol requires that in the event that “the civilian population of any territory under the control of a Party to the conflict, other than occupied territory … is not adequately provided …. relief actions which are humanitarian and impartial in character and conducted without any adverse distinction shall be undertaken, subject to the agreement of the Parties concerned in such relief actions”. Israel is in clear and material breach of these stipulations, even in a declared state of war, and even if its denial of the status of an Occupying Power were to be accepted. This has never been a secret from the global community. The purpose of the blockade was put with absolute clarity by an adviser to Israel’s prime minister in 2009: it was “to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger”. Israel also has claimed that the blockade on Gaza is a form of legitimate “economic warfare”. An official document noted in 2010 that Israel’s blockade of Gaza conformed with the principle that “a country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, or that it wishes to operate using ‘economic warfare’” (Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law, 2010: 402-03). In 2011, a cable unearthed by Wikileaks has Israel informing the US that its object was to keep the “Gaza economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis”. To achieve this goal, Israeli officials employed “mathematical formulas to monitor foodstuffs and other basic goods entering the Strip to ensure that the amount of supplies entering was neither less nor more than the (permitted) amount”. These privations are imposed on Gaza with the object of creating unbearable stresses in society. With a sufficient accumulation of such stresses, Israel believes, Gaza would be compelled to evict Hamas from all positions of authority. This puts Israel flagrantly in violation of the law of armed conflict, since the enforced suffering of civilians cannot be used as a means of achieving political and military objectives. Perversely, the larger political context creates an incentive for Israel to sustain the blockade indefinitely, irrespective of any expression of peaceable intentions on the other side. Gaza has long since been banished from Israel’s territorial ambitions. It is seen as unmanageable, just too minute a territory with many more people than Israel can deal with. Israel’s territorial aims today include in the near future, the annexation of a substantial part of the West Bank. Keeping Gaza in in a permanent state of global ostracism and blockade, serves its purposes very well. If Israel was already in a declared state of war with Gaza till the morning of October 7, the events that day were obviously part of a continuum. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres did no more than point this out, when he set off a frisson of faux outrage from the Israeli ambassador to the world body, who called on him to resign and announced that all cooperation with its agencies would cease. That is yet another instance, one among an infinite number, when Israel has used bluster and bullying, with the connivance of the US, to force certain themes off the global dialogue. Even as the demonstrators who refuse to vacate the streets bear testimony to the manifest failure of this strategy, certain curiosities endure. If Israel was already in a war with Gaza, why was the declaration or the renewal of such a state on October 7 necessary? And in the context of a war that was already underway, how were Hamas’s actions of October 7 to be viewed? To add to these curiosities, Israel that day sought in a noisy, obstreperous clamour of self-righteousness, the right to defend itself against a people it had placed on a blockade and kept on the verge of starvation as a matter of policy. Members of the orthodox Hasidic Jewish community lead the call for ceasefire in Gaza, Brooklyn, NY, Saturday, October 29. Photo: Sunita Viswanath The term “terrorism” applied to the October 7 attacks has empowered Israel’s grossly disproportionate response under a dangerously vague and open-ended mission of “eliminating” Hamas for all time. The First Additional Protocol by Article 1(4), extends all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to peoples “fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination”. This has been read, though not without controversy, as the legally enshrined right of an occupied people to assert their right to self-determination by armed means. Armed resistance is legitimate where necessary, though within the universally applicable norms of proportionality and military necessity. “Proportionality” is a difficult parameter to estimate in all circumstances. But when weighed in the scale of Israel’s history of occupation and blockade, and the massive military operations it has carried out in Gaza prior to October 7, it becomes virtually impossible to quantify. Leaving that aside, it is a fact that video records from that day, reviewed by respected global rights bodies, have provided undeniable evidence of war crimes, warranting an investigation by the International Criminal Court. Proportionality in the application of international legal norms would then require an investigation of Israel’s conduct, both before and after October 7. And Israel has very early on, signalled its utter disdain of every norm, with its deliberate policy of bombing entire neighbourhoods out of existence, its order for the relocation of Gaza’s residents, and its attacks on hospitals after serving brief notice for their evacuation.  Amid the very visible evidence of mass murder, there has been a call for the nuclear bombing of Gaza by an Israeli cabinet minister, Amihai Eliyahu. He earned a reprimand from Israel’s prime minister, perhaps more for the public revelation of Israel’s clandestine nuclear arsenal than for the genocidal intent. Avi Dichter, another cabinet minister, spoke of the ongoing operations as the “Gaza nakba”, or catastrophe, an Arabic term used to describe the mass displacement of Palestinians that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. When questioned about this assertion, Mark Regev, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister embraced the sentiment, ascribing all the blame, as he put it, to irresponsible Palestinian leadership. A number of special rapporteurs and independent experts retained by the UN for their special expertise have meanwhile, warned that Israel’s words and deeds express an overt genocidal intent: “We are deeply disturbed by the failure of governments to heed our call and to achieve an immediate ceasefire. We are also profoundly concerned about the support of certain governments for Israel’s strategy of warfare against the besieged population of Gaza, and the failure of the international system to mobilise to prevent genocide.” This is followed by a call to action: “The international community, including not only States but also non-State actors such as businesses, must do everything it can to immediately end the risk of genocide against the Palestinian people, and ultimately end Israeli apartheid and occupation of the Palestinian territory.” International law is of course an imperfect instrument to enforce the will of the global community. With all its ambiguities, the Geneva Conventions are the best available guide to how the world should be, not to how the world is. In reality, the law is what the powerful say it is. An ancient adage resurfaced by the historian E.H. Carr in his classic critique of the theory of international relations puts it best: justice is the right of the strong. Now, more than ever, is a time when international civil society has to agitate for the right to be heard by ruling establishments. Global demonstrations demanding that Israel be held accountable have not shown any sign of fatigue, despite the forces arrayed on the other side, and the application of draconian new laws to silence their voices. That is perhaps the sole bright spot in a bleak global scenario.  Sukumar Muralidharan is an independent writer and researcher based in the Delhi region.

https://thewire.in/security/over-ambition-half-baked-ideas-military-integrated-theatre-commands,Security,Over-Ambition and Half-Baked Ideas Plague the Military’s Plan for Integrated Theatre Commands,"The central project of India’s military reforms – Integrated Theatre Commands (ITCs) for jointness in combat – has once again fallen through the cleavage of over-ambition and half-baked ideas. This is a substantial setback for the office of the Chief of Defense Staff (CDS), whose primary job was to create ITCs after directing the three service chiefs to find consensus among themselves. This is not because India needs the ITCs, but because to retain the retiring, but ideologically aligned army chief General Bipin Rawat in uniform, the government on December 30, 2019 created the office of the CDS, under the ruse of military reforms. Within days, Rawat announced that implementation of the ITCs after acceptance by the three services (army, air force, navy) will commence in December 2022, at the end of his three-year term.   Even after four years, the military reforms remain on the drawing board, there are clearly problems with them that Rawat, and after his untimely death, his successor, General Anil Chauhan were trying to thrust upon the Indian military. The biggest is that they are outdated, being 22 years old. Following the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan, the Group of Ministers (GoM) had, in February 2001, recommended the creation of the CDS post to usher in jointness amongst the services.  Since then, China, instead of Pakistan, has emerged as India’s primary military threat with capabilities to fight in six physical and virtual war domains of land, air, sea, outer space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic spectrum space, and capacities (indigenous defence industrial complex) to support these domains with war surge without outside support.  Now, military reforms are done for two reasons: One, to improve war concepts (how to fight) to optimise war domains’ usage to exercise control over war aims, speed, tempo, intensity, and outcome. And two, to use military power beyond guarding one’s territorial sovereignty to influence global events (called out-of-area operations). By 2013, China had met both conditions for military reforms. By 2010, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had developed its six war domains, and in 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced his ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which required the PLA to protect Chinese infrastructure, assets, and people in nations onboard the BRI.  Given this, China announced its expansive 2015 military reforms to be completed in five years and under which it created Western Theatre Command (WTC) for joint combat with the Indian military on the disputed border. Interestingly, a reforms committee formed under China’s Central Military Commission (the highest military policy-making body headed by Xi Jinping) in 2012 took three years to work on reforms at the grandest and most granular levels before declaring them to the world.  Sadly, the Indian military missed the PLA’s upward trajectory since it kept its sights low doing counter-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir since 1991 and, on contemplating building deterrence (military power) against the Pakistan military. Hence, the US Pentagon’s third offset strategy to negate the PLA’s conventional war advantage through the infusion of artificial intelligence and autonomy declared in 2014 went unnoticed by the Indian military leadership.  So, when Rawat started work on ITCs, he, without constituting a reforms committee, made his own assumptions on the wars that India should prepare for with Pakistan and China. He shared periodic and piecemeal revelations of his vision for a year and a half with select media, and finally unveiled his military reform plan in a television interview on July 2, 2021. According to him, since future wars would be at short notice and of short duration, it was necessary that all war domains (army, air force, and navy) should have jointness (where domains fight together and as one whole) and integration for synergy (where each domain has cross-domain capability, making the total more effective than the whole). Moreover, in ITCs, since a theatre commander should have assets permanently under his command, he would be able to assemble a ‘joint force’ quickly to achieve a given mission.   Rawat’s plan had four big operational flaws. One, since the PLA can fight in six war domains against three of the Indian military, it will combat at strategic (cyber, space, information war) or whole-of-nation level, and operational or campaign level totally bypassing the tactical level or battles where attrition happens. Recall, the 1991 Operation Desert Storm where the US military conducted a 43-day intense air campaign against the Iraqi army, followed by 100 hours of mopping up operations on the ground. However, war with Pakistan will be different since both Indian and Pakistan militaries fight attrition wars at tactical levels.  Two, whether a war between India and China will be short or long would be determined by the stronger side. So, China will decide this depending upon the war objectives it wishes to accomplish. Three, unlike China, India does not have a vibrant defence industrial complex to support even an intense short war against the PLA. And four, it is not possible for India to fight three different wars with China, Pakistan, and counter-terror operations in Kashmir simultaneously.  Strangely, the above operational flaws do not seem to bother the military leadership. Their concerns are three-fold. First, how to accommodate senior officers of the present seventeen separate military commands of the three services into three or four ITCs. Hence, talks are going on to create more integrated commands for logistics, missiles and so on. Second, the Indian Air Force (rightly so) is unwilling to permanently part with its limited combat aircraft to the ITCs. And three, services chiefs who are both topmost staff officers (force providers) and operational commanders (force employers) of their respective services are not agreeable to giving up their force employers role to ITC commanders.  The need is to abandon ITCs and focus on building the science of war (technologies) and the art of war (war concepts) concurrently. And hope that there is no war with China or Pakistan since both are joined at the hip.

https://thewire.in/politics/modi-only-hope-says-opposition-delegation-in-meeting-with-manipur-governor,Politics,Modi ‘Only Hope’ Says Opposition Delegation in Meeting with Manipur Governor,"New Delhi: A delegation of ten opposition parties in Manipur met governor Anusuiya Uikey on Friday and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the “only hope” to resolve the ongoing conflict in the state and urged her to facilitate a meeting with him. Manipur has been in the grip of ethnic violence between the Kuki and Meitei communities since May 3 in which over 175 people have been killed and more than 60,000 displaced.  The opposition parties’ delegation included the Congress, Janata Dal United (JD(U)), Communist Party of India (CPI(M)), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), All India Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Thackeray), Aam Admi Party and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). Joined the delegation of 10 like minded political parties leaders and met the Hon’ble Governor of Manipur and submitted a detailed memorandum for the early restoration of normalcy and peace in Manipur. @RajBhavManipur @AnusuiyaUikey @INCManipur @INCIndia pic.twitter.com/KFNSX6SHO9 — Gaikhangam (@Gaikhangam2) November 18, 2023  A copy of the letter submitted to Uikey, posted on X (formerly Twitter), showed 14 signatories including the Congress’ K. Meghachandra, former Manipur chief minister O. Ibobi Singh (Congress), CPM’s K. Santa Singh, JD(U)’s K. Loken Singh (JDU), CPI’s L. Sontinkumar Singh, NCP’s S. Iboyaima Singh and TMC’s T. Inaocha Singh. In their memorandum, the opposition parties said that the conflict which is over six months old now has caused huge loss of lives, property and displacement of over 60,000 people belonging to both the communities. It said that the living conditions of the internally displaced people in relief camps is “inhuman and far from satisfaction.” “There are instances of sporadic killing, firing and kidnapping of people including students, thereby leaving the people in great tension, uncertainty and hardships especially to those living on the periphery/borders between hills and valleys. The social and economic lives of all sections of the society have been uprooted.” The parties said that the peace committee constituted by the Union government has not done “any visible work” to restore peace and harmony in the state. “Considering the complexities of the conflict in the state, a viable solution to the conflict can only be brought about by the Union government. We consider the Hon’ble Prime Minister of the India is the only hope for bringing peace in the state.” Modi who has not visited strife torn Manipur in the six months of the conflict has faced criticism from opposition parties for not speaking on the issue. On August 10, the second last day of the monsoon session of parliament, Modi broke his silence on the floor of the parliament about the ongoing violence in Manipur while replying to the no-confidence motion moved against his government. However, in his speech that lasted around 2 hours 20 mins, Modi spoke about the violence hit-state. Last month Modi gave a miss to campaigning in election bound neighbouring Mizoram – the one state election where the prime minister did not go ahead of the polls. The Modi government has also defended its BJP government in the state and claimed that chief minister N. Biren Singh is cooperating with the Union so there is no need to remove him from office. After the meeting on Friday, the Raj Bhavan issued a statement and said that the governor had assured the delegation that “every possible step for initiating dialogue process will be taken up and she will pursue the Prime Minister for initiating talks with all political parties in the state,” reported The Telegraph. Uikey also said to the the delegation that she “is in touch” with central leaders and had submitted reports about the unrest while seeking “steps to end it”.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/security/iaf-lands-super-hercules-military-transport-aircraft-on-unfeasible-strip-for-tunnel-rescue-mission,Security,IAF Lands ‘Super Hercules’ Military Transport Aircraft on Unfeasible Strip for Tunnel Rescue Mission,"Chandigarh: In yet another instance of operational daredevilry, the Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully landed two of its Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 ‘Super Hercules’ military transport aircraft at a rudimentary and unfeasible air strip in Uttarakhand. This mission was carried out in inclement weather, to deliver heavy engineering equipment to help rescue workers trapped inside a nearby under-construction mountain tunnel. In an official statement, the IAF said that its two C-130J-30’s executed three sorties to the rudimentary Dharasu advanced landing ground (ALG) on November 15. This was carried out in ‘reduced visibility conditions’, to ferry 27.5 tons of machinery needed to extricate 41 construction workers, entombed since Sunday, in the collapsed tunnel being built on Uttarakhand’s Yamunotri National Highway. The narrow and undeveloped 3,600 feet ALG, located at an altitude of 3,000 ft, some 30 kilometre from the mishap site, had earlier been declared ‘unsuitable’ by the IAF for C-130J-30 operations. Despite this, the urgency in reaching the critical equipment to rescue teams spurred the IAF and its pilots to, yet again, exploit their jugaad or innovative skills and fabled derring-do to professionally vindicate their mission objectives. Ahead of undertaking the delivery flight, an IAF helicopter with C-130J-30 pilots on board had executed an exhaustive recce of the ALG’s questionable condition and the many obstructions it posed, before eventually undertaking the equipment delivery mission. Thereafter, varied aspects of the reconnaissance were suitably ‘war-gamed’, taking all impediments into consideration, and an operational plan was then formalised. The quasi-military Border Roads Organisation, or BRO, was roped in to clear the ALG of thick undergrowth and shrubbery, and in the best tradition of jugaad that defines a wide spectrum of its operational activity, as well as that of the Indian military, it also constructed a makeshift mud ramp to substitute for specialised off-loading equipment, simply unavailable at the remote ALG. Based on inputs from the helicopter reconnaissance mission over Dharasu, the ‘non-routine critical delivery’ mission featured two C-130J-30’s from the IAFs 77 ‘Veiled Vipers’ Squadron at Hindan, on New Delhi’s outskirts, and was ably completed in under five hours. The IAF declared that the entire operation was underscored by a ‘calculated approach and adequate risk mitigation’. Its success, it added, stemmed from ‘pinpoint execution’. One of the IAF’s other, larger, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III air lifters, too, were involved in the tunnel rescue operations. One of them shipped 22 tons of heavy equipment from Indore to Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun, from where it was shipped to Dharasu by road, for onward transshipment to the accident spot. The IAFs daredevil Dharasu delivery operation was reminiscent of its 17 daring flights, featuring C-130J-30’s and C-17s, which were undertaken earlier this year as part of Operation Kaveri to repatriate thousands of Indians from war-torn Sudan. At the time, The Wire had reported on some of these C-130J-30 flights, which were executed in pitch darkness, with calmness and dexterity on the unfamiliar Wadi Sayyidna airstrip that had neither any navigational approach aids nor critical landings lights, some 40 km north of the Sudanese capital Khartoum, wracked by civil war. The IAF’s fleet of 12 C-130J-30s, inducted into service 2011 onwards, are split between the 77 Squadron at Hindan and the 87 ‘Wings of Valour’ Squadron at Panagarh in the east, from where they support the Indian Army’s deployment along the disputed line of actual control (LAC) with China. The IAFs 11 C-17s operated as part of No 81 “Skylords’ squadron, also from Hindan. Both aircraft types were acquired via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route, with the C-130J-30’s costing around $2-2.5 billion and the C-17s priced at around $4.1 billion. In recent times, both platforms had been instrumental in transporting army personnel – and their assorted assets-like tanks and infantry combat vehicles – to the LAC to counter the ongoing three-year-long face off with China’s People’s Liberation Army. The IAF had last acquired some 70-odd second-hand twin-piston engine Fairchild C-119 ‘Flying Boxcars’ from the US in the 1950s, after which New Delhi’s relationship with Washington deteriorated and those with Moscow proliferated, lasting the duration of the Cold War era, which ended only in the early 1990s. The C-119s, however, were retired in the 1980s, following their extensive employment in two wars with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971. Hence, for over five decades thereafter, the IAF remained dependent almost entirely on legacy Soviet-origin transport platforms. This was in addition to combat aircraft-like the Ilyushin Il-76s and Antonov An-32s, which a cross-section of IAF pilots maintained had recently been ‘technologically outmanoeuvred’ by the newly inducted US transports. “The fully automated, state-of-the-art flight decks of both the US models fitted with +4 generation avionics were far superior to those of the two Soviet transports, making them relatively effortless to operate,” a former IAF transport pilot said, declining to be identified. Besides, the US platforms were ‘significantly’ more fuel efficient, requiring a smaller, three-person crew – two pilots and a loadmaster – to operate, compared to five personnel needed for an Il-76 and four for an An-32, he said. Besides ease of operation both in the air and on ground, the US transports had a 12-week maintenance cycle, which was almost three times higher than that of the Il-76s and even the 60-70 retrofitted and upgraded twin-turboprop An-32s, both of which required regular servicing every three to four weeks, said the C-17 pilot quoted above. “The total technical life cycle of C-130J-30 and C-17 engines, too, is notably higher – almost 10 times more than that of the fuel-intensive Soviet aircraft power packs,” retired Air Marshal V.K. Bhatia said. This operational aspect increased platform efficiency and considerably reduced maintenance and operating costs, he added. Besides, by undertaking the Dharasu delivery mission, the IAF had ‘stretched’ the C-130J-30’s operational envelope, possibly even a little beyond what its manufacturers Lockheed had anticipated and could, in time, further boost the transport platform’s commercial appeal. Or as the adage goes, the only way to discover the limits of the possible, is to go beyond them into the impossible; or in this case, the near-impossible, an endeavour in which the Indian military excels on multiple fronts in exploiting its assorted platforms and equipment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://thewire.in/security/indigenously-developed-zorawar-light-tank-expected-to-begin-trials-later-this-month,Security,Army: Indigenously Developed ‘Zorawar’ Light Tank to Begin Trials Later This Month,"Chandigarh: The first prototype of India’s indigenously developed light tank, principally for deployment in Himalayan border regions along the disputed border with China, is expected to begin trials later this month, ahead of the eventual construction of at least 354 examples of the platform for the Indian Army (IA). Quoting official sources, media reports recently revealed that although somewhat delayed, the 25-tonne air-transportable and amphibious light tank named Zorawar would undergo rigorous high-altitude trials for an extended period. Developed jointly by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and private vendor Larsen & Toubro (L&T), the artificial intelligence-enabled tank is agile and fitted with an active protection system, industry sources said. They said that developmental setbacks followed troublesome negotiations with Germany over supplying the DRDO MTU 800-1,000hp water-cooled V8 high-altitude-optimised engines for the tank, which were recently scrapped despite diplomatic intervention to help clinch the purchase. Thereafter, an alternate 1,000hp advanced combat engine from Cummins in the US was acquired to power the tank, which is armed with a 105mm gun acquired off-the-shelf from Belgium-based multi-national armament manufacturers John Cockerill. Integrated with tactical drones to provide situational awareness and loitering munition capability, these light tanks were primarily for employment along the line of actual control (LAC) in Ladakh, where the IA has been locked in a stand-off with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) since May 2020. It is believed that the DRDO-L&T designed tanks will more than match the mobility, fire power and accuracy of the PLA’s 30-33 ton ZTQ105/Type 15 light tanks, presently deployed along the LAC. China’s Type-15 tank. Photo: 颐园居/Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 4.0. Fitted with a 105mm rifled gun with a 3,000m range, the Chinese light tanks were capable of being airlifted and even paradropped by the PLA Air Force’s Y 20 military transporters. The IA ultimately aims on inducting seven light tank regiments of around 315 tanks – with another 40-odd platforms in reserve – for which the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had accorded its Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) in December 2021. An AoN is the first of around 10-11 procurement procedures needing completion under the MoD’s Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 (DAP-2020) for most materiel purchases. The DRDO had shortlisted L&T as its developmental partner for the light tank programme in an arrangement in which the latter would, after trials, series-build 59 of these armoured vehicles. The remaining 290-odd vehicles would be tendered out to other local manufacturers under DAP-2020s ‘Make in India’ category to obviate charges of ‘partiality’ towards L&T, industry officials said, but added that these arrangements were ‘flexible’. The IA’s light tank project, like a myriad other of its programmes, has endured extended birth pangs. Desultory attempts to develop one such armoured vehicle were initiated in the 1980s, in which the DRDO replaced the turret of the Soviet-designed BMP infantry combat vehicle (ICV) with a 105mm gun. But the project was eventually terminated in 1994 due to indifference by the army which, by then, had declared light tanks to be ‘superfluous’. DRDO, which is the R&D wing of the Union defence ministry, shortlisted L&T as its developmental partner for the light tank programme. Photo: The Wire. Undaunted, the DRDO designed another light tank based on the same licence-built ICV chassis by mounting it with a French GIAT TS-90 turret and a 105 mm gun. Firing and stability trials were conducted, but once again due to the army’s indifference the project was shelved. Consequently, like most such projects which, like a yo-yo, alternate between conception, abandonment and revival, the light tank programme surfaced once again in 2008 after Indian military planners shifted their strategic focus from Pakistan to the security threat posed by China, which was designated the country’s number-one enemy. This prompted the IA to issue a global request for information (RFI) in 2009 for 200 wheeled and 100 tracked light tanks, weighing 22 tons each, that required the modularly constructed platforms to be ‘highly manoeuvrable’ with surveillance and communication capability to execute multi-purpose operations. According to the Preliminary General Staff Qualitative Requirements (PGSQRs) formulated by the army’s Mechanised Forces Directorate at the time, both the 8×8 wheeled and tracked light tanks were to be 2.8m high and 7.8m long and needed to possess a low silhouette and amphibious capability. The PGSQRs further stated that they were required to be fitted with a 105mm or 120mm gun, capable of firing an assortment of projectiles. High ground clearance, defensive aid suites offering protection against laser, thermal and radar-guided munitions and nuclear, biological and chemical protection completed the projected tanks’ specifications. Also Read: On the India-China Border, Disengagement Is Not Resolution Operationally, these light tanks were envisaged as being part of the two mountain divisions that were then under raising – since commissioned – for deployment along the 3,488km-long LAC. A proportion of them were also considered as potential force multipliers to India’s ‘cold start’ doctrine against Pakistan of going on the offensive in a limited war scenario, under the nuclear umbrella, to achieve ‘bargainable’ military gains. Alongside this, it was argued that these platforms could also be deployed in urban and semi-urban environments, and in riverine terrain and marshy ground along India’s eastern borders. Responses to the RFI were received, but thereafter no formal tender or request for proposal was issued, as the entire proposal, like many others, was shelved because of the army’s apathy and internal disputes over indigenising the programme. But above all, competing financial claims concerning existing T72M, T90S and Arjun main battle tank (MBT) ventures sealed the light tanks’ fate, and it was consigned to the ‘out’ tray at army headquarters. Such short-sightedness and myopia would come back to haunt the IA decades later in 2020, when the PLA occupied large swathes of territory claimed by India.  Meanwhile, with the subsequent induction of light tanks into service, the IA will have the dubious distinction of becoming one of the world’s fewer armies that deployed four different tank types. Presently, the IA operates 3,500-odd licence-built Russian T72M1 ‘Ajeya’ MBTs, and directly imported and domestically assembled and constructed T90S ‘Bhishma’ platforms, alongside 124 indigenous Arjun Mk1 MBTs. Another 118 Arjun Mk1A variants worth Rs 8,350 crores were on order from the state-owned Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi near Chennai. And more incredulously, if the IA proceeds apace with its 2021 plans, made known via an RFI, to acquire a ‘family’ of 1,770 medium weight Future Ready Combat Vehicles (FRCV) by 2030, the army will have the dubious distinction of simultaneously fielding five kinds of light and heavier MBTs. “Besides the massive capital investment needed to acquire new tanks, their inventory management, which even today poses a formidable challenge to the army, will become even more acute with diverse additional platforms,” said military analyst Major General A.P. Singh (retired). Adding another two entirely new tank types to the existing assortment will only make this task nightmarish, he warned. Furthermore, acquiring sector-specific platforms like light tanks, principally for deployment in mountainous regions along the LAC, would significantly exacerbate the army’s logistical obligations by imposing an additional financial burden, the former armoured corps officer added. Also Read | ‘Two Steps Forward, One Step Back’: The Chequered Story of India and China’s Border Tensions Paradoxically, the Pakistan Army (PA) too matches the IA in that it has five MBT types, qualifying such tank-upmanship to be part of the competing rivalry between the neighbouring nuclear states, which underscores sundry aspects of existence in the respective countries. The PA fields 1,800 to 2,000 tanks, of which only the Ukrainian T-80UD MBT is the outlier platform. The remaining four MBTs – Type 85-11AP, Al-Zarar, Al-Khalid and VT-4/MBT3000 – are either licence-built Chinese models or have been jointly developed in conjunction with China, thereby conferring a high degree of structural correlation between them. This renders not only their manufacture but also their logistic and maintenance support less problematic compared to that of the IA. Of the world’s major armies, the US operates variants of the M1 Abrams MBT, whilst Israel fields the Merkav, Britain the Challenger-2, Canada the Leopard 2A6M, Germany the Leopard and France the Leclerc MBT respectively. The Russian army, for its part, has T72, T80 and T90 MBTs – all with a high degree of commonality – and has only recently begun inducting the T-14 Armata based on a common Universal Combat Platform. In recent years, senior military analysts and veterans have critiqued the IA for focusing unduly on major platforms like MBTs and not enough on future technologies like robotics, artificial intelligence, and cyber and electronic warfare. In their writings, they have observed that relatively inexpensive ‘swarm drone’ squadrons have in recent months effectively destroyed advancing columns of hugely expensive MBTs, rendering them ineffective on the battlefield. Perhaps an operational audit on the nature of future conflicts is overdue for the IA, instead of persisting with what generations of army commanders feel ‘comfortable’ planning for and executing, with numerous tank types like in the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He also stressed on the importance of Israel abiding by the rules of war and conducting its operations in a way that minimises civilian casualties. He suggested that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a tradition of talking tough and then blaming others for not being able to fulfil his promises or threats. In this instance, the American president will provide the occasion and opportunity [to Netanyahu] for backing out of the tough action he has up until now promised. In a 28-minute interview to Karan Thapar for The Wire, Pinkas said he believes there is credible evidence to accept that last night’s bombing of the Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, which allegedly killed around 500 people, was not the responsibility of the Israeli Defence Forces but the result of a failed rocket launch by the Islamic jihad. While saying this, he cited Al Jazeera, who he said have a correspondent who saw the failed rocket launch hit the hospital. Afterwards The Wire discovered this was possibly based on a tweet which is fake news. Al Jazeera does not have a correspondent who reported she saw the Islamic jihad rocket misfire. This interview was recorded minutes before President Biden arrived in Israel and also minutes after the Israeli Defence Forces’ press conference conducted by their spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, ended. Pinkas criticised both the Palestinian President and King Abdullah of Jordan for refusing to meet President Biden, and for cancelling the Jordan summit. He said that this is far from being a setback for the American president; it’s a serious mistake made by the two Arab leaders. He does not believe the likelihood of either Hezbullah or Iran getting involved in the conflict and, therefore, the danger of the conflict spreading further in the region is not imminent.

https://thewire.in/security/security-forces-send-back-39-myanmar-soldiers-taking-refuge-in-mizoram,Security,Security Forces Send Back 39 Myanmar Soldiers Taking Refuge in Mizoram,"New Delhi: Thirty-nine soldiers of the Myanmar military, who had been taking refuge in Mizoram, were sent back to their country by Indian armed forces on Tuesday, November 14. The decision to send them back came after the camp in which the soldiers had been staying came under attack from ethnic armed groups aligned with the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar. Two choppers belonging to the Indian armed forces were deployed to evacuate them from their camp in Champhai, the headquarters of Mizoram’s Champhai district bordering Myanmar. They were flown to Moreh in Manipur, which shares a land border with Myanmar’s Sagaing region. “The entire operation from evacuating the Myanmar soldiers to Moreh and sending them across towards Tamu (nearest Myanmar town from Moreh) was over by 3 pm,” an Army officer monitoring the exercise said, according to The Hindu. The official also added that there were reports of two more Myanmarese soldiers crossing over into India in the last 24 hours. He said they would also be sent back once security personnel locates them. The civil war in Myanmar, which has been on since February 2021, intensified in the last few days in the region close to the Mizoram border. The fighting between the country’s Army and pro-democracy groups, including ethnicity-based extremist groups, has gone up by several notches. According to Indian security officials, a fierce gunfight broke out between the two sides at Khawmawi in Myanmar, which is located across Zokhawthar in Mizoram’s Champhai district on Sunday, November 12 evening. About 1,500 Myanmarese have been taking refuge in border areas of Mizoram following the gunfight, officials added. Besides ethnic armed groups aligned with the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar, the Kuki Independent Army, Kuki National Army, and the Chinland Defence Force also attacked the Myanmarese military camp in Mizoram. A military camp in Rikhawdar near Khawmawi was also overrun by the other side. Fearing for their lives, the 39 soldiers ran for cover to reach Mizoram on Monday evening. The decision to allow Myanmarese soldiers into India resulted in protests from Chin refugees of Myanmar, who staged a protest outside the Zokhawthar police station where the soldiers were kept. The soldiers were handed over to the Assam Rifles, according to a senior police officer. Since the outbreak of civil war in Myanmar in February 2021, Mizoram has been hosting more than 35,000 Chin refugees. They are taking refuge in schools, community halls, temporary sheds, and the homes of relatives across Mizoram.

https://thewire.in/government/centre-extends-ban-against-eight-meitei-extremist-organisations-for-10-years,Government,Centre Extends Ban Against Eight 'Meitei Extremist Organisations' for 10 Years,"New Delhi: The Union home ministry has extended the existing ban on eight “Meitei extremist organisations”, under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for advocating the secession of Manipur from India through an armed struggle. Under the UAPA law, the Centre called them an “unlawful association” while accusing them of inciting people of Manipur for secession, a government notification issued on Monday, November 13, stated. The eight outfits are namely, the Peoples’ Liberation Army widely known as PLA, and its political wing, the Revolutionary Peoples’ Front (RPF); the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) and its armed wing, the Manipur Peoples’ Army (MPA); the Peoples’ Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) and its armed wing, the ‘Red Army’; the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) and its armed wing, also called the ‘Red Army’; the Kanglei Yaol Kanba Lup (KYKL); the Coordination Committee (CorCom); and the Alliance for Socialist Unity Kangleipak (ASUK). According to The Hindu, the notification said the outfits have been engaging in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India by employing and engaging in armed means to achieve their objectives. Towards this end, they have been attacking and killing the security forces, police and civilians in Manipur. They are also indulging in acts of intimidation, extortion, and looting of the civilian population for collection of funds, the notification added. The organisations have also been accused of making contacts with sources abroad to influence public opinion and for securing their assistance by way of arms and training for the purpose of achieving their secessionist objective and maintaining camps in neighbouring countries for the purpose of sanctuaries, training, and clandestine procurement of arms and ammunition. The extended ban, which came into effect on November 13, will remain in force for 10 years hence. According to the previous 2018 notification, the said outfits were involved in 756 violent incidents from January 1, 2013- July 31, 2018, and killed 86 persons, including 35 security personnel during the same period. The latest notification, however, omitted reference to the number of violent incidents the organisations were involved in the past five years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/armed-forces-tribunal-shopian-killings-bhoopendra-singh,Law,J&K: Tribunal Sets Free Army Captain Held for 2020 Shopian Killings: Here's What the Bench Said,"Srinagar: The Armed Forces Tribunal has suspended the sentence and granted bail to the Army captain who was awarded life imprisonment by an Army court for killing three men in a staged gunfight in southern Kashmir’s Shopian district in July 2020. Key observations The tribunal’s principal bench comprising chairperson Rajendra Menon and member C.P. Mohanty, in its order on November 9, granted bail to the captain, Bhoopendra Singh, who, according to the separate probes carried out by the Army and police, was involved in the murder and abduction of three civilians, including a juvenile, on the intervening night of July 18 and 19, 2020 in Amshipora hamlet of Shopian district. The court martial proceedings had held him guilty of six charges, including murder, and awarded life imprisonment to him. The officer had approached the tribunal against the court martial proceedings, saying that they were conducted in an “illegal” and “arbitrary” manner and “manipulations” were carried out to make him a “scapegoat”. In its observations on the plea for suspension of his sentence, the tribunal raised serious questions on the court martial proceedings, calling its findings as “perverse” and “improper”. “In our considered view for the purpose of considering the application for suspension of sentence and bail, the prima facie assessment by us is sufficient enough to prima facie come to a conclusion that the finding recorded in the trial is not proper and seems to be a perverse and improper finding,” the tribunal noted. The tribunal observed that evidence relied upon during the court martial proceedings is not convincing enough to hold the captain guilty of the charges levelled against him. “Prima facie, based on the material available, we are convinced that the likelihood of the captain being acquitted after hearing this appeal cannot be ruled out,” the bench said. The tribunal bench, however, said that the findings recorded by it are only for the purpose of adjudicating the plea for suspension of sentence and “shall not cause any prejudice to any of the parties at the time of trial.” Also read: Three ‘Militants’ Killed in Shopian ‘Encounter’ Were Ordinary Labourers, Families Allege Questions on statements of accused and witnesses The tribunal found that the confessional statement of the captain during the court of inquiry – when he was in close arrest – was not recorded in accordance with the requirements of the law. It said that the statement of the captain recorded by the Board of Officers was in breach of different provisions of the Indian Evidence Act. “In our considered view, heavy reliance has been placed by the SGCM [summary general court martial] on the confession statement of the applicant recorded by the Board of Officers during the conduct of the CoI and at the time the applicant was in close arrest. In our considered view, the confession statement recorded by the Board of Officers is in clear violation to the requirement of section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, so also in breach of sections 24, 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act,” the tribunal said. It also raised questions on the validity of statements made by Bilal Ahmad Lone and discarding of the statement of Tabish Nazir Lone, during the trial. Both Bilal and Tabish were Army informants. The tribunal said that the confession statement of Bilal Ahmad Lone, who was an accused in the case but turned an approver and has been pardoned by the chief judicial magistrate Shopian, cannot be used for convicting the captain. “Relying upon the statement of a co-accused, in our considered view, and further, is in breach of the provisions of section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act wherein it has been stipulated that based on the statement of a co-accused, a conviction cannot be ordered,” the tribunal observed. It questioned the discarding of the statement of Tabish Nazir Lone, who turned hostile, during the trial, saying it becomes creditworthy and can be relied upon when read along with material on record.

The tribunal, in its view, said that there cannot be any motive for the captain to conduct such an operation without the knowledge of the commanding officer. It further noted that perusal of statements of some prosecution witnesses “throw some light with regard to the fact that prior information of the operation and permission from the CO was available and there was also sharing of location including deletion of chat from [W]hatsapp”. The captain, in his appeal, has claimed that sequence of events shared in a WhatsApp group of the company and the battalion were deleted as soon as the Court of Inquiry was ordered. Also read: ‘Give Me His Body’: Father Insists Young Man Killed in Shopian ‘Encounter’ Was Innocent Expenditure of arms and retaliatory firing The AFT said that exorbitant expenditure of arms and ammunition, as indicated in the situation report, discredits the case of prosecution to a large extent. The tribunal said that the situation report and statements of some witnesses indicated retaliatory firing on the Army which had visited the place for the operation. When contacted, advocate Sudhanshu S. Pandey, counsel for Bhoopendra Singh, said that their stand is vindicated because the summary general court martial had not followed the “basic principles of criminal justice system.” “I am highly grateful to the court for delivering justice to the young officer,” he said. We feel they have been killed again: Families Meanwhile, the families of the victims registered their shock. “It is another July 18 [the day when the three were killed in 2020] for us. I feel that they have killed our children for the second time. I couldn’t believe it when someone from Srinagar informed me over phone yesterday that the accused has been released from the jail,” said Yosouf, father of Ibrar Ahmed (25), one of the three civilians who had been killed in Amshipora. “I was relieved after the captain was sentenced to life imprisonment but I couldn’t sleep last night after hearing that he had been released. I will do whatever is required to get justice again,” he added. 16-year-old Mohammad Abrar. Photo: By arrangement Fifty-year-old Bagga Khan, father of 16-year-old Muhammad Abrar Ahmed, one of the victims, termed the verdict a grave injustice with the families. “Everyone promised that justice will be done with us after they came to know that those killed were innocent civilians. Is it justice? We will fight for them till the last breath of life,” he said. As reported by The Wire then, on August 15, 2020, young Abrar had gone to Shopian to work as labourer in the orchards to earn money for his Class 10 admission fee and books. Disappearance of trio, Army’s claims, police’s probe Abrar, Imtiyaz and Ibrar disappeared in Shopian area of southern Kashmir on the intervening night of July 18 and 19. The next day, the Army claimed to have killed three unidentified militants in a gunfight. A day later, Brigadier Ajay Katoch, commander of 12 Sector Rashtriya Rifles claimed that the Army had received “human intelligence inputs” about the presence of four to five unidentified militants in Amshipora. He claimed that the Army personnel came under fire twice from the militants before they were neutralised. However, on August 10, 2020, three families from Rajouri district of Jammu province claimed that those killed by the Army were their relatives who had come to Shopian to work as labourers in orchards. The families identified those who were killed based on pictures of the dead bodies which went viral on social media. After these claims, the Army and the J&K police ordered separate inquiries into the matter. On October 3, 2020, the bodies of the deceased were exhumed from a graveyard in Baramulla. The investigations by the Army and the police, along with DNA tests, confirmed that the three who were killed in the alleged gunfight were the three youngsters from Rajouri. The police investigation in the case revealed that Army Captain Bhoopendra Singh alias Major Basheer Khan first abducted the three young men in a private car from their rented accommodation at Chowgam Shopian with the help of two accomplices. The captain, as per police probe, killed the three men and planted “illegal weapons and material on their dead bodies and tried to tag them as hardcore terrorists”. The police claimed that the accused captain furnished false information and misled the senior officers to obtain the prize money of Rs 20 lakh. However, the Army said that there was no system of cash awards for its officers for any acts in combat situations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/security/manipur-a-blueprint-with-immediate-and-long-term-measures-to-help-contain-violence,Security,Manipur: A Blueprint with Immediate and Long-Term Measures to Contain Violence,"The recent statement by the chief minister of Manipur that the violence in the state is 90% under control is shocking given the fact that almost six months of ethnic violence there remains unabated and keeps flaring up sporadically. The situation is far worse than even what prevailed during the partition. Even at the height of ethnic cleansing during that time, there still remained and continue to exist several pockets where minority communities continued to live peacefully within the majority-dominated areas. Malerkotla in Punjab and Nuh (notwithstanding the recent aberration caused by some troublemakers from outside) in Haryana are such examples of peace and harmony. Similar islands of Hindu minorities exist in Sindh province in Pakistan and many areas in Bangladesh. The situation is entirely different in Manipur. The ethnic divide between the Kuki and Meitei people in Manipur is complete. Being at the receiving end of violence, there are no more Kukis left in the Valley dominated by Meiteis and similarly no Meiteis remain in hill areas dominated by Kukis. In fact, the establishment has been compelled to separate Kuki and Meitei communities from each other by way of creating buffer zones and deploying security forces along these buffer zones to regulate entry and exit in a manner similar to what happens on an international border. Also read: What’s Behind the Manipur Violence and Why Stopping It Poses a Test For Modi Thousands of automatic weapons, including rocket launchers and lakhs of ammunition, have been looted from police and India Reserve Battalion (IRB) armouries. These are being used by perpetrators of violence with impunity in targeting civilians. The state government has been reduced to meekly requesting the looters to return these weapons and ammunition without any result. Over 200 lives have been lost and more than 75,000 persons have been internally displaced. However, the lack of action on the part of both the Union and state governments (ruled by the BJP) is inexplicable. This inaction has angered the public against both the state and Union governments. The state unit of BJP is reported to have stated this in unequivocal terms in a letter written to the center, “…. public anger and protests are slowly turning the tide, placing the responsibility of this prolonged disturbance squarely on the government’s failure to address the situation”.  The chief minister who is a Meitei himself appears to be fast losing support within his own community with his house and the house of the state BJP chief being attacked by Meitei people. Representative image of a Manipur Police checkpoint. Photo: X/@manipur_police It is a sad reflection on the incompetence of institutions of state if a large part of the population has no faith in state police and are compelled to raise and depend on Village Defence Committees to ensure their own safety and security from people of other community. The incompetence of the Manipur Police has been proved beyond doubt by its abject surrender to mobs who looted their armouries. People do not trust it to provide security to them. Not only the police, the bureaucracy as well as state government have proved themselves to be totally incompetent. People have lost confidence in the institutions of the state. The writ of the state doesn’t appear to run any longer in Manipur and it is fully and truly in the midst of a civil war. The situation if not controlled doesn’t portend well for the peace and stability of the entire North East India, large parts of which were in turmoil till a few years ago. In spite of the situation being so serious and its ramifications for the future of the Northeast, the policy of the Union government continues to remain in drift. It is surprising to note that the Union government continues to repose faith in Biren Singh in spite of violence. The statement by the Union home minister that chief minister has not been removed because “he is cooperating” is bewildering because the decision about the imposition of the President’s rule has to be based on the law and order situation in the state. It is irrefutable that the law and order situation in Manipur has broken irrevocably and the imposition of the President’s rule would have been a logical step to restore normalcy. The fact that Manipur Police and Assam Rifles deployed to control the violence are not trusted by one or the other parties in conflict makes the case for imposition of the President’s rule even stronger. Decisions like leaving out 19 police stations located in the valley – dominated by the Meitei community – while extending AFSPA to the rest of the state or scrapping of “suspension of operations” agreement only with Kuki insurgent groups are astonishing and smack of partisan state leadership. The Meitei insurgent groups, however, not only continue to remain armed, they have, in fact, added to their inventory with most of the arms looted from police having gone to them. Also read: 143 Days for Manipur Mayhem: The Centre Must At Least Give Biren Singh Marching Orders Now The status of imposition of Article 355 remains shrouded in mystery in spite of the fact that a retired IPS officer has been appointed to oversee the functioning of Manipur Police purportedly under provisions of this article. However, no notification regarding the imposition of 355 is available in the public domain. In a reported response to an RTI query, MHA was not able to provide any clarity on this issue by stating that they do not have any information on the imposition of Article 355. The officer appointed for such oversight is supposed to report directly to the Union government in order to obviate any interference by the state government. However, being an outsider, this officer probably does not have any control over the day-to-day functioning of Manipur Police, which is deeply divided along ethnic lines. Police, the main agency responsible for controlling the situation, are acting in a partisan manner. The situation is so bad that police personnel belonging to one community cannot go to patrol the area where the other community is dominant. The Peace Committees set up in June have achieved no success and violence continues. Early resolution of the conflict is extremely important to ensure that the secessionist insurgency in the North East isn’t revived. The burning of over two hundred churches and almost two dozen temples may also be exploited by communal elements by giving it a colour of the Hindu-Christian conflict. In fact, the chief minister of Mizoram in a recent interview to a prominent media group has alluded to the communal nature of the problem. With inimical neighbours like China ever ready to fish in troubled waters, the integrity of the nation is at stake. The suspicion amongst communities is so deep-rooted that bringing normalcy will be a long-drawn affair. However, a start has to be made and the first step in that direction must be to contain widespread violence. Priority therefore must be to restore peace at the earliest. Imposition of the President’s Rule in the early stages itself would have gone a long way in controlling the violence through the deployment of centrally controlled and impartial Central Armed Forces, like CRPF, BSF, ITBP, SSB, etc., besides the Indian Army. Imposition of the President’s rule and deployment of these forces even at this stage will infuse confidence amongst people as these forces are unconcerned with local ethnic loyalties. This cannot be said of Manipur Police which is accused of openly siding with the Meitei community. On the other hand, Assam Rifles is accused of being partial towards Kukis by Meiteis. The imposition of the President’s rule will also remove the Biren Singh Ministry – which has lost legitimacy in the eyes of all communities – and create confidence amongst the population. It is important that the weapons looted by miscreants must return to the armouries. The armed forces will have to conduct aggressive operations to recover these. This is possible only by delegating adequate powers to them through the imposition of AFSPA in the entire state including 19 police stations in the Manipur valley left out of its ambit so far. Delegation of such powers to Central Armed Forces will enable them to operate freely and conduct searches and combing operations to recover the looted weapons besides enabling them to apprehend insurgents, extortionists, and criminals indulging in violence and stop indiscriminate killings and help establish the Rule of Law. Special investigating teams and fast-track courts should also be considered to investigate and bring the culprits to trial at the earliest. Bringing perpetrators of violence, and those who have committed heinous crimes, especially against women and children to justice is the only way of bringing closure for the victims. Gun drop box placed in Imphal Manipur. Authorities are asking people to voluntarily return snatched and looted weapons. Photo: Twitter The political leaders and bureaucrats must increase their visibility in the trouble-prone area and visit them frequently to assess the situation firsthand and redress grievances of people on the spot, wherever possible, in order to restore the confidence of the masses in the establishment. The peace committees need to act proactively and be innovative in their approach. People with impeccable integrity must be identified and incorporated into these committees. The community leaders, like village heads (known as “Gaon Budhas” in those areas) who are well respected by communities in the North East, and prominent women organisations must be roped in to initiate dialogue amongst communities and remove suspicion and schism between communities. The realisation that the lives of different communities are inexorably interlinked and interdependent is the only way to contain the violence. Naga leaders – who have continued to remain neutral – can be gainfully utilised to bring about a rapprochement. Long-term measures  Priority must be given to ensure effective Border Management of India – Myanmar Border to prevent illegal entrants from coming in and settling down in India which is said to be one of the main reasons for the strife in the state. The deployment of a border guarding force close to the border will also ensure the effective implementation of the “Free Movement Regime” and proper maintenance of records of local tribals coming in and going out. Deployment of Border Guarding Force and the consequent necessity to create infrastructure for providing logistics to troops deployed close to the border on BOPs will add to employment and therefore prosperity of the border population. Deployment of a force exclusively for Border Guarding will also release the entire Assam Rifles for dedicated deployment to control internal security problems in Manipur and other States of the North East which is the primary role of this elite force. The government must also ensure that remote areas of the state are provided with good administration and that the fruits of development reach the Hill communities. One of the major grievances – and true to a large extent – of Kukis is that most of the development has taken place in the 10% Valley area occupied by Meiteis. The remote hill areas must be developed and provided connectivity. My own experience in Churachandpur in Manipur is that bureaucrats and police rarely if ever visit remote areas unless, of course, things have changed in the last 10 years since I was there. The remote hill areas are still in a time-wrap with hardly any facilities and access to institutions and authorities to project their problems. As late as 2007, it took me over six hours to reach Behang – a border town along the India-Myanmar border from Churachandpur – a distance of only about 70 kilometres. My contacts informed me that there has been only a marginal improvement in the situation even after 15 years. As provided in Article 371C of the constitution, the Committee of the Legislative Assembly of the state consisting of members of the Manipur Assembly elected from the Hill Areas of the state should be allowed to function effectively. Arrangements like Autonomous District Councils may also be considered in order to give more autonomy to Hill districts. Necessary financial grants should be made available to these councils to enable them to carry out developmental work. Also read: Manipur: Both Centre and State Played a Principal Role in Ethnic Violence, Claims Fact-Finding Team The Act East policy of India, which is aimed to enhance connectivity, trade, and improve relations with our Eastern neighbours, should be extended to include the development of North Eastern states and improve connectivity which is presently restricted only to main towns or capital cities of these states. Railway and Road networks are said to be the greatest integrators of communities. India must focus on ensuring connectivity to the remotest parts while at the same time ensuring that the fragile ecology of the area is not disturbed. We must enhance investment to improve the human development index. Focused investment in the education sector, environment-friendly industry, and agricultural activities in these states are essential. Investment in industry and infrastructure will lead to better avenues for employment and wean citizens away from indulging in violent criminal activities and drugs. The network of rail and roads in the remotest parts of these states is essential to integrate them with the main stream. Allotting large tracts of land for something like Palm cultivation as widely reported in media doesn’t appear a viable option as it will adversely affect the biodiversity of the area. Planting palm oil trees harms the quality of the soil, depleting large amounts of nutrients from the soil thus degrading it. The resultant increase in use of herbicides, insecticides, and fertilisers contaminates water bodies and affects groundwater and the aquatic biodiversity. It is important to stop poppy cultivation in hill areas of Manipur through effective surveillance and deterrent action besides affirmative action by providing sustenance alternatives. People should be encouraged to take to poultry farming, dairy farming, and cattle rearing. The hill area having terrain and weather conditions similar to other areas of the Northeast, should be suitable for coffee, pineapple, orange, banana, and medicinal plantations or even rubber plantations. These cash crops will provide alternative means of income to hill people and thus decrease dependency on Poppy cultivation. File photo of violence in Manipur. Photo: Twitter/@MangteC The question of the inclusion of Meiteis in Schedule Tribe has to be deliberate, deeply after taking all factors into account. The authorities must consider recommendations made by various committees set up by the government from time to time in this regard. Assessment of five important criteria with regard to the Meitei community namely, primitive traits, distinct culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness recommended by the Lokur Committee in 1965 will provide useful insights in determining the issue. The recommendations of the Bhuria Commission (2002-04) which focused on a wide range of issues from the Fifth Schedule to tribal land and forest, health and education, working of Panchayats, and the status of tribal women to determine the Schedule Tribe status will also provide a benchmark to decide this vexed issue. Besides these, the recommendations made by the High-Level Committee (HLC) under the chairmanship of Prof Virginus Xaxa in 2013 to study critical issues related to tribal communities, like livelihood, employment, education, health, involuntary displacement, and migration besides legal and constitutional matters must also be studied. An important point to consider is that the grant of Scheduled Tribe Status to Mieteis will deprive them of the benefit of SC and OBC reservations in government jobs. The model of reservations in government jobs adopted by Nagaland also should be studied. While all 16 Naga tribes are eligible for reservation as Schedule Tribes for Union government jobs, only eight most backward Naga tribes are eligible for reservation in state government jobs. However, the demand of Meiteis for Schedule Tribe Status is mainly for the purpose of purchasing land in Hill areas not for reservation in government jobs. The most important reason for strife in Manipur is the Land. The grouse of the Meitei people is that they are confined to just about 11% of the land area of the state in the valley being deprived of acquiring land in the hill areas because they do not have the status of Scheduled Tribes. The land in Manipur is regulated by two laws. First, The Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960 (MLR & LR Act, 1960)” and the other pertaining to the regulation of land in Manipur is ‘The Manipur Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2014 (Manipur Act No. 10 of 2014)’ aims to conserve the paddy land and wetland and to restrict the conversion or reclamation thereof in order to promote growth in the agricultural sector in Manipur. T The Manipur Land Reform and Land Revenue Act, 1960 is extended to the whole Valley along with a small portion of the hill area. The state government of Manipur has attempted on several occasions to make some amendments to MLR & LR including efforts to introduce the New Land Use Policy, 2014. Each such attempt has led to more conflict and polarisation in the state as these are considered to interfere with the tribal land ownership system based on traditional customary laws. These are considered attempts to marginalise the tribals and alienate them from ownership and possession of land. Tribal lands are privately owned by tribal individuals and remaining lands belong to whole community of respective village. In case of Kuki tribe, the village chief is generally accepted as the owner of all lands of village. Section 158 of the MLR and LR Act provides special provisions regarding Scheduled Tribes. This Section states that “No transfer of land by a person who is a member of the Scheduled Tribes shall be valid unless – … (b) where the transfer is to a person who is not a member of any such tribe, it is made with the previous permission in writing of the Deputy Commissioner, provided that the Deputy Commissioner shall not give such permission unless he has first secured the consent thereto of the District Council within whose jurisdiction the land lies…”. However, since the MLR & LR act is not applicable to hill areas, this legal protection is theoretically not available to hill areas implying that non tribals can buy land in Tribal areas. Reportedly, there have been some such land transactions in the past. Under such circumstances the authorities need to take a close look at the entire gamut of Land laws and identify issues which need proper interpretation and implementation to the satisfaction of all ethnic communities. Continued turmoil in Manipur is a serious threat to the security and integrity of India. In the worst-case scenario, it has the potential to turn into a secessionist insurgency or a festering communal problem at best (sic). Restoring normalcy at the earliest is most important. The situation therefore must be addressed with urgency, the first step towards which is to ensure that violence is contained while at the same time simultaneously preparing ground for addressing issues having long-term implications as discussed above. As the common saying goes “Roof must be repaired when the sun is shining.” It is still not too late and the authorities must rise above the parochial consideration of ethnicity, religion, and region to resolve it.

https://thewire.in/security/citing-the-israel-hamas-war-nso-group-sought-urgent-meeting-with-blinken,Security,"Citing the Israel-Hamas War, NSO Group Sought Urgent Meeting With Blinken","New Delhi: The Israeli firm, NSO group, which is known for Pegasus spyware and blacklisted by Washington, has asked for a meeting with the US State Department, including Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, in connection with the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Two years ago, the US government added Israeli companies, NSO group and Candiru to the Commerce Department’s ‘entity list’, which is a federal blacklist that would restrict exports of US technology to the company. The move was dictated by “evidence that these entities developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers”. The Wire had been part of an international collaborative investigation known as ‘Pegasus Project’, that tracked the leaked database of thousands of telephone numbers that were believed to have been listed by multiple government clients of NSO group. Comprising 17 news organisations in 10 countries, the Pegasus Project was coordinated by Forbidden Stories with technical support of Amnesty International. A couple of months after being blacklisted, NSO group hired a law firm, Los Angeles-based Paul Hastings LLP, to conduct an active lobbying effort to get out of the entity list in January 2022. This was initially reported by ProPublica. On November 7, partner at Paul Hastings, Timothy Dickinson, sent a letter and an email to request an “urgent meeting” to the US State Department. The documents were publicly filed with the Justice Department as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. NSO Group’s latest action was reported first by The Intercept. “I am writing on behalf of [the] NSO Group to urgently request an opportunity to engage with Secretary Blinken and the officials at the State Department regarding the importance of cyber intelligence technology in the wake of the grave security threats posed by the recent Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel and their aftermath,” said the letter. The Haaretz had earlier reported that NSO and other Israeli spyware firms had been working with the Israeli government to track down missing hostages. Quoting experts, The Intercept noted that the NSO was using the current crisis to make space for the group to return to the good books of Washington. “NSO’s participation in the Israeli government’s efforts to locate citizens in Gaza seems to be an effort by the company to rehabilitate its image in this crisis,” said Adam Shapiro, director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now, a group founded by the slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi to advocate for human rights in the Middle East. “But alarm bells should be ringing that NSO Group has been recruited in Israel’s war effort.” The Pegasus Project had traced the use of the Pegasus spyware on the phones of close kin of Khashoggi prior and after his killing inside the Saudi consulate in Ankara. In the letter to Blinken, Dickinson wrote that “NSO’s technology is supporting the current global fight against terrorism in any and all forms. These efforts squarely align with the Biden-Harris administration’s repeated messages and actions of support for the Israeli government, including from a defense and cybersecurity perspective.” He said that the technology can be “misused” by end-users to violate human rights, but claimed that NSO had taken “concrete steps to address potential downstream human rights impacts of its products”. The NSO group had been in financial doldrums since it came into public spotlight through the Pegasus Project and then the blacklisting by the US Commerce Department. The Financial Times had reported in 2022 that the value of NSO had been deemed worthless to its private equity backers and has not received any new customer bookings since July 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jaishankar and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh. For the first time, there was no joint press conference addressed by all four ministers after the end of the ‘2+2’ discussions. India’s foreign and defence secretaries addressed the media, while Austin and Blinken had separate briefings with their travelling media. With discussions ranging from China to South Asia and West Asia to Ukraine, the two sides had a lot to talk about, besides the usual bilateral agenda of strengthening cooperation in defence and a host of other sectors. Concluded a substantive India-US 2+2 Ministerial Meeting. Followed up on PM @narendramodi’s State visit to the US this June. Our agenda covered advancing our strategic partnership, including elevating our defense ties, moving forward in space & tech, future logistics… pic.twitter.com/f7ezKlM0tj — Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) November 10, 2023  However, it was particularly noteworthy that Blinken chose to directly address the Canadian issue during a separate bilateral meeting with his Indian counterpart Jaishankar preceding the talks on Friday morning. India’s relations with Canada had nosedived after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused unnamed Indian government agents of being implicated in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen described by India as a Khalistani terrorist. From the beginning, the United States has consistently urged India to participate in the Canadian investigation, a sentiment reiterated by Blinken during his visit to New Delhi on Friday. “As a friend of both, we think it’s very important that India work with Canada on its investigation, and that they find a way to resolve this difference in a cooperative way,” he told reporters. Following a reciprocal expulsion of one diplomat each by Canada and India, an additional 41 Canadian diplomats departed when New Delhi insisted on downsizing Ottawa’s diplomatic presence in the Indian capital. India had also stopped visa services for Canadian nationals, a restriction that was partially lifted after approximately three weeks. Canadian officials said that the downsizing of their staff in India would increase the overall visa processing time for Indian nationals. Photo: Krokodyl/CC BY-SA 3.0. India’s foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra reiterated that New Delhi remained concerned about security implications from the threats made by Khalistani separatists against Indian diplomats. “We have made our concerns very, very clear,” he told reporters on Friday. “We have core security concerns and I am sure you are all aware of a recent video that has surfaced from one such individual.” Canadian officials reportedly intercepted communications among Indian diplomats suggesting India’s involvement in Nijjar’s death, but New Delhi has reiterated that it has not received any evidence from Ottawa about the killing. US ambassador to Canada David Cohen had said that “shared information” from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance had informed Trudeau’s decision to go public with the allegations. Incidentally, the joint statement released following the conclusion of the discussions emphasised the two nations’ shared commitment to “advance democracy, human rights, and pluralism”. Notably, the phrase ‘human rights’ was included in this statement, distinguishing it from the joint statement issued after the ‘2+2’ talks in 2022, which only mentioned democracy and pluralism. Barring the differences over Canada, India and the US were upbeat that they had reached strategic alignment on several crucial areas.

Using blunt language, Singh asserted that both India and the United States were in agreement when it came to addressing the challenges posed by China. “We increasingly find ourselves in agreement on strategic issues, including countering China’s aggression, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and addressing regional security challenges,” said Singh at the start of his bilateral talks with Austin. India is currently in the midst of a military stand-off with China on the Line of Actual Control that began in April-May 2020. While several of the friction points have witnessed de-escalation, the two strategic areas of Depsang and Demchok continue to show no sign of resolution. Incidentally, the United States has been actively pursuing a meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided to skip the summit despite a standing invitation extended to him during Biden’s visit to India for the G-20 summit. Speaking with the media, US defence secretary Austin said that the talks did cover the “threat posed by China”, but noted that entire dialogue was not spent just discussing the Asian giant. Along with China, the joint statement on the ‘2+2’ talks demonstrated their similar position on the Israel-Hamas war. “Noting horrific terrorist attacks against Israel, the ministers reiterated that India and the United States stand with Israel against terrorism and called for adherence to international humanitarian law, including with regard to the protection of civilians,” said the bilateral document. Also Read: By Siding With Israel, India Is Jettisoning Decades of Middle East Statesmanship Calling for the immediate release of all hostages, the joint statement further stated that the two sides were committed to “continue coordinating with partners in the region on humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs of Palestinian civilians in Gaza”. India and the US reiterated their support for “humanitarian pauses”. This is a day after Israel agreed to allow the halting of fighting for four hours every day. “They expressed support for humanitarian pauses and committed to continue close diplomatic coordination, including with key partners in the region, to prevent the conflict from spreading, preserve stability in the Middle East, and work toward a political solution and durable peace,” said the joint statement. Immediately after the October 7 attack by Hamas, Modi had expressed “solidarity” with Israel. However, a week later, India had to balance Modi’s statement by reaffirming support for the “Palestinian cause” and the two-state solution. Despite this, India abstained from a resolution at the UN General Assembly calling for humanitarian pauses, arguing that it should also have condemned the October 7 attack that resulted in the death of 1,400 people. Blinken said that Israel’s action to allow for ‘humanitarian pauses’ was positive but not enough. “Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,” he told reporters in New Delhi on Friday, at the end of his nine-day sojourn through the Middle East and Asia. Gaza’s health ministry has said that over 11,000 Palestinians were killed in Israeli counter-strikes. Photo: Palestinian News & Information Agency (Wafa) in contract with APAimages/Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 3.0. He continued: “Far too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximise the assistance that gets to them.” According to Gaza’s health ministry, the death toll among Palestinians in Israeli counter-strikes has exceeded 11,000 people. Absence of Pakistan in the joint statement Although both nations expressed solidarity with Israel against terrorism, this year’s joint statement notably omitted any mention of Pakistan or “cross-border” terrorism, a departure from previous editions. At the inaugural ‘2+2’ joint statement in 2018, the four ministers had “called on Pakistan to ensure that the territory under its control is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries”. It had also denounced the use of “terrorist proxies in the region”. Similarly, the joint statements of the second, third and fourth ‘2+2’ ministerial dialogues had explicitly named Pakistan and referred to the need to stop “cross-border” terror attacks. But there is no mention of Pakistan in the 2023 joint statement. There is not even an oblique reference to the South Asian country through the euphemistic term ‘cross-border’ terror. In 2022, the joint statement had talked about exchanging information about the “cross-border movement of terrorists” in the same sentence about the need for implementing sanctions against terror groups, countering violent radicalism and use of the Internet for terrorist purposes. Also Read: Pakistan Is Stuck and India Is Stuck Next to It This year, the negotiated joint statement stated that the ministers “condemned terrorism and violent extremism, and the use of terrorist proxies and logistical, financial or military support to terrorist organisations, which could be used to launch or plan terrorist attacks, including international attacks”. It reiterated the need for justice for the 26/11 and Pathankot terror attacks, as well as the need for action against UN proscribed terror groups “such as Al-Qa’ida, ISIS/Daesh, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammed”, but without any explicit mention of Pakistan, for the first time since the start of the ministerial-level dialogue. Bangladesh also featured in the India-US ministerial talks, highlighting the differing approaches between India and the US in the lead-up to the general elections there next year. The Bangladeshi opposition has threatened to boycott the elections if a caretaker government is not established. The US has started to impose visa restrictions on members of the ruling establishment for allegedly being complicit in undermining free and fair elections. Foreign secretary Kwatra said that India shared its perspective on Bangladesh clearly. “It is not our space to comment on the policy of a third country … the election in Bangladesh is their internal matter and it is for the people of Bangladesh to decide their future,” he stated. Bangladesh’s main opposition party, the BNP, has held large protests in recent months in the country. Credit: Jubair Bin Iqbal/CC-BY-SA-4.0. Disagreeing with the American approach, the senior Indian diplomat added that as a “close friend”, India “respect[s] the democratic process in Bangladesh and will continue to support the country’s vision of a stable, peaceful and progressive nation”. A day earlier, the spokesperson for the Indian external affairs ministry had declined to censure the Bangladesh government for the arrest of senior opposition leaders ahead of the polls. Earlier this week, an Awami League leader had threatened to “beat up” US ambassador to Dhaka Peter Haas, which was criticised by the State department. On the defence front, Austin reiterated the importance of the co-production of an armoured vehicle. The two countries also agreed to set up “new liaison positions to facilitate seamless communication and cooperation between their armed forces”.

https://thewire.in/rights/in-hyderabad-policing-of-teens-under-operation-chabutra-is-turning-violent,Rights,"In Hyderabad, Policing of Teens Under ‘Operation Chabutra’ Is Turning Violent","A term that gained notoriety in Hyderabad recently is “chabutra.” Contrary to the local population’s perception of a chabutra as a place of social gathering, it is perceived by the Hyderabad South Zone police as a place where youngsters indulge in illegal activities and criminal conspiracies late at night. This has led to a new form of policing: temporary detention of youngsters who step out after midnight in the city.  In 2015, Sri Satyanarayan the deputy commissioner (DCP) of the South Zone police initiated Operation Romeo and Operation Chabutra to discourage young individuals from gathering at chabutras and engaging in allegedly harmful activities. This practice was primarily aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of underage reckless bike riding, encouraging youngsters to use their time wisely and discouraging unnecessary late-night roaming that the police believed could potentially contribute to criminal activities. What is a chabutra? Chabutra is a colloquial term used in Hyderabad that refers to a raised platform or a pavement area typically found outside houses in residential areas. These structures often serve as community spaces for neighbours and residents to congregate, relax, or engage in conversations.  Historically, chabutras have played an integral part in the city’s design, and cultural fabric and in fostering a sense of community and social interaction. The concept of a chabutra draws its inspiration from the traditional village settings in India where community members and elders would gather beneath a grand tree to engage in conversations and deliberate on matters concerning families and society. In many Indian villages, this platform also served as the assembly ground for the local panchayat to conduct their meetings. It’s a common practice in India to have small indoor and outdoor platforms within neighbourhoods where people sit and converse. Over time this concept transformed. What was once a symbol of community bonding started to be associated with gatherings of youngsters, especially late in the night. These gatherings often involved socialising, chatting, and sometimes activities that raised concerns, including fights. Why are chabutras targeted by the police? The police have been focusing their attention on chabutras due to a series of incidents in which conflicts between two groups or even disputes among friends escalated to tragic outcomes, including loss of life. These unfortunate incidents have raised concerns within the police force about night-time gatherings in the old city areas. Information provided by local media and police informants suggests a correlation between these gatherings and the occurrence of violent incidents.  Therefore, the police say they are laying more emphasis on ensuring that young individuals do not congregate in localities post-midnight. This “proactive approach”, they say, aims to prevent confrontations and altercations, reduce the likelihood of violence and ultimately preserve public safety. The police’s assumption that these gatherings could potentially lead to conflicts or illicit activities raises important questions. Indeed, there are instances of such gatherings causing disturbances to residents and also serving as locations for criminal activities. It’s crucial to recognise that within neighbourhoods, there are designated spots, often in alleyways or side streets, frequented by known troublemakers or individuals with criminal backgrounds. However, it’s important to distinguish between these specific individuals and the broader community. Can young people be prohibited from gathering with friends? Is it justifiable to curtail their freedom of peaceful assembly based on a few reported instances of crime in the old city? Does the law permit the detention and harassment of youth, simply for sitting outside their residences? These are critical questions that warrant thoughtful examination and consideration. There’s a positive aspect to chabutras that merits consideration. It has been observed that when residents, including youngsters, gather in their localities, it serves as a deterrent to crime and criminal activities. The presence of community members can discourage outsiders from attempting criminal acts, as they would be less likely to go unnoticed or unchallenged. This highlights the potential for chabutras to provide a space for social interaction and enhance security and cohesion in the neighbourhood. Therefore a nuanced approach that addresses the concerns posed by gatherings that lead to disturbances and criminal behaviour while preserving the valuable role they can play in maintaining a safe and connected neighbourhood environment is necessary. Police harassment The underlying motivation behind police operations in specific localities is complex and often influenced by various societal factors, including caste, class, and religious biases. To comprehend this intention, one must acknowledge the existing societal biases which shape the attitudes of government agencies, particularly the police.  Historically, there has been a tendency to stereotype certain communities and areas, which subsequently impacts the orientation of law enforcement personnel. In the case of Hyderabad’s old city, it has often been portrayed as an area with potential criminal elements, extremists, and terrorists. The Muslim community which resides there has frequently faced police harassment, before and after the formation of Telangana. Muslim youth have been disproportionately targeted and detained in alleged terrorism cases, subjecting them to years of harassment, particularly following the Babri Masjid demolition. This biased perception is not accidental; rather, it is a deliberate part of the training and conditioning of law enforcement agencies. Muslims are often unfairly portrayed as radicalised and potential extremists or terrorists, contributing to a global narrative that emerged post-9/11, when international agencies began associating terrorism with the Muslim community. In addition to the biases against Muslims, caste and class factors also influence the mindset of bureaucrats and law enforcement officers. There is a perception that individuals from backward communities with lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to engage in criminal activities. This perception leads to the targeting of poor and vulnerable localities through measures such as cordon and search operations and ‘Mission Chabutra’.  Conversely, affluent and educated neighbourhoods often escape similar scrutiny. This imbalance in police operations reflects a broader societal bias, where individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are disproportionately targeted, while those from privileged backgrounds enjoy relative impunity. Operation Chabutra has been portrayed in a positive light by the police with the help of local media. But of late, there has been a surge of videos showing police using violent force on youngsters, including instances of the police continuously hitting teenagers with lathis. This escalation of violence on a large scale across an entire community of people is a dangerous trend emerging out of Hyderabad. While the local population initially supported a non-violent way of policing youth, they are increasingly concerned about this escalation. The tragedy of this exercise is that instead of following the rule of law, the police have become the lawmakers in Hyderabad.  S.Q.

https://thewire.in/government/pm-narendra-modi-congress-naxal-violence-union-government-data,Government,Modi Says Congress Failed To 'Control Naxal Violence’ – Union Government Data Shows Otherwise,"New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a rally in Chhattisgarh on Tuesday, November 7, that whenever the Congress comes to power, incidents of terrorism and Maoist violence increase and accused the grand old party of failing to contain Maoist violence in the poll-bound state. “Whenever Congress comes to power, the courage of terrorists and Naxalites increases in the country… The Congress government has failed to control Naxal violence,” he said at a rally in Bishrampur, Surajpur. “Wherever you see there is news of bombs going off in one place or the other, killings here and there. Such news would come. In whichever state the Congress is in power, crimes, loot and plunder rule. Congress has been unsuccessful in containing Naxal violence. In recent times several BJP workers have been taken away from us. A few days ago, one of our workers was shot dead,” he said. However, a look at the Union government’s own data on Maoist violence over the years belies Prime Minister Modi’s claims about Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh. In fact, Union home minister Amit Shah, during the campaign, noted the reduction in Maoist violence and gave credit to his party. MHA data shows reduction in Maoist violence  According to data available on the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) website, there has been a decline in the number of civilians killed by Left Wing Extremism (LWE) since 2010. Civilian deaths have fallen consistently over the past few years, from 722 in 2010 to 82 in 2022. Source: MHA In terms of attacks on economic infrastructures, the number of incidents or attacks also decreased since 2010, the same website shows. The attacks decreased from 365 in 2010 to 42 each in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Source: MHA Replies in parliament also note decline in LWE incidents In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha in the monsoon session that ended on August 11, the MHA stated that according to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, police and public order are with the state governments.  “However, to address Left Wing Extremism (LWE) menace holistically, Government of India (GoI) approved ‘National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE’ in 2015 envisaging a multi-pronged strategy involving security-related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. Steadfast implementation of this policy has resulted in consistent decline in LWE-related violence and its geographical spread,” said the written reply dated August 9, by MoS Home Nityanand Rai. Rai also provided a year-wise breakup of LWE incidents and deaths since 2018. 118** 63** Source: Reply in Rajya Sabha (August 9, 2023) *Incidents perpetrated by Left Wing Extremists **Incidents initiated by Security Forces In 2018, there were 833 incidents and 240 deaths in the country, followed by 670 incidents and 202 deaths in 2019, 665 incidents and 183 deaths in 2020, 509 incidents and 147 deaths in 2021. From 2022, the data shows the number of incidents perpetrated by LWEs and incidents initiated by the security forces. There were 413 incidents perpetrated by LWEs and 118 incidents initiated by security forces, while 98 deaths were recorded that year. In 2023 (till July 15), there were 273 incidents perpetrated by LWE and 63 incidents initiated by the security forces, along with 79 deaths. In response to a question by Chhattisgarh MP Deepak Baij, Rai said in a written reply in Lok Sabha on March 21 that there “has been significant improvement” in the LWE security situation in the country in the last five years. Rai also provided specific figures on Chhattisgarh that stated: Source: Written reply in Lok Sabha (March 21, 2023) Amit Shah claims credit for decline in Maoist violence While Modi said on Tuesday that incidents of Maoist violence have increased, last month addressing a rally in Jagdalpur, home minister Amit Shah said that Maoist incidents have declined in the last nine years. “In nine years of the Modi government, incidents of (Naxal) violence declined by 52%, deaths (in Maoist violence) came down by 70%, civilian deaths decreased by 68%, while the (number of) Naxal-affected districts declined by 62%,” he was quoted as saying. After chairing a review meeting of LWE with state chief ministers and top security officials on October 6, the MHA in a press release also gave similar figures. In an interview with The Wire, Baij, who is the Chhattisgarh Congress chief, accused the Union government of trying to take credit for the decline in Maoist incidents and pointed to contradictory statements by BJP leaders. “The Union government is trying to take credit for the good work done by the Chhattisgarh government. These are double standards in the Union government’s policies and this won’t work. Amit Shah says something, [BJP president J.P.] Nadda says something else. Different leaders are saying different things and they are not on the same page on this [matter] either. But the Chhattisgarh government has done good work and there is peace in Bastar,” he said. In February, Nadda – like Modi – claimed that Naxal activities had increased in Chhattisgarh under the Congress government. Amit Shah at Muzaffarpur. Photo: X/@AmitShah Union government’s role in controlling LWE According to the MHA’s division to tackle LWE, which was created in 2006, the Union government’s role is to deal with it in a “holistic manner” while the primary responsibility lies with state governments. “In dealing with this decades-old problem, it has been felt appropriate, after various high-level deliberations and interactions with the State Governments concerned, that an integrated approach aimed at the relatively more affected areas would deliver results. With this in view, a detailed analysis of the spread and trends in respect of Left Wing Extremist violence has been made and 70 districts in ten States have been taken up for special attention with regard to planning, implementation and monitoring various interventions. However, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ being State subjects, action on maintenance of law and order, lies primarily in the domain of the State Governments. The Central Government closely monitors the situation and supplements and coordinates their efforts in several ways,” it says. These efforts include providing the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs); sanction of India Reserve (IR) battalions; setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) schools; modernisation and upgradation of the State Police and their Intelligence apparatus; reimbursement of security-related expenditure under the Security-related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme; providing helicopters, training, sharing intelligence, facilitating inter-state coordination, etc.  “The underlying philosophy is to enhance the capacity of the State Governments to tackle the Maoist menace in a concerted manner,” it says.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/security/india-armed-forces-politicisation-by-default-or-design,Security,Whither India’s Armed Forces: Politicisation by Default or Design?,"Before joining active service, an Indian soldier – all ranks of the Army, from jawan to General, and their equivalents in the Navy and Air Force – takes oath as follows: “I will bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of India as by law established and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully serve in the regular Army of the Union of India and go wherever ordered by land, sea or air, and that I will observe and obey all commands of the president of the Union of India and the commands of any officer set over me even to the peril of my life.” Thus, the soldier’s obedience is to the president of India and his loyalty is to the constitution of India.  While the serving soldier is governed by military law in addition to every other law which governs every citizen, certain fundamental rights available to every citizen are denied to him by Section 21 of the Army Act and the Army Rules “because of the nature of duties performed by the members of the regular Army and for the maintenance of discipline among them”. Specifically, Army Rule 20 prohibits “political and non-military activities”.  Over the decades, the command structure of India’s armed forces has preserved the highest standards of professional conduct and performance, and the apolitical character of the serving soldier.  Back in 1932, a Field Marshal advised young Indian Army officers: “The young Indian man of education seems very attracted by politics. May I urge you to remember that politics do not, and cannot, find any place in army life. An army can have no place in politics. Once there is any suspicion that an Army, or any part of it, is biased politically, from that moment that Army has lost the confidence of the nation which pays for it. It is no longer impartial, and that way lies chaos and civil war.” Public trust    A 2019 survey of public opinion relating to politics, society, and governance, revealed that people trust the Army the most, with the judiciary next. The least trusted are the police, government officials, and political parties.  India’s public recognises the apolitical nature of India’s armed forces, as a criterion for trust.  Also Read: Commandeering Civil Services and Armed Forces for Propaganda Could Make India a Failed State Soldiers on leave  The Army has the legacy problem of short-staffing of officers, and post-COVID-19, among personnel below officer rank. The Army has maintained operational capability and readiness, at the cost of increased stress during active service. It is established that stress is a prime reason for suicide among troops. Leave is a de-stressing, precious time away from the extreme rigours of service, when soldiers spend quality time with family and attend to matters that spouses were unable to do.  Ensuring soldiers’ leave is a responsibility of military commanders, essential for individual and unit morale, far more than a welfare measure or part of terms of service.  In this well-understood situation, the Army Headquarters directed – although the word used is “recommended” – that “every soldier proceeding on leave volunteers to choose any subject/domain as per own interest/competency and the felt need of one’s local community, and engages citizens, thereby making an individual contribution to the Indian Army’s nation-building effort”. Short-staffed units are to provide soldiers with literature, to use for their “voluntary” efforts on social, civic and patriotic themes, such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, etc. The unit will monitor compliance using photographs and videos which the soldier takes. Pressure to comply will cause stress during leave, and anxiety on return to duty station, perhaps defeating the purpose of leave.  The soldier-on-leave “voluntarily” promoting government schemes can be negative for the Army’s morale and functioning.  Showcasing performance  On October 9, 2023, the Ministry of Defence directed defence establishments to set up 822 geo-tagged ‘selfie points’ in nine cities, to “showcase good works done in defence”, and “attract public attention”. The armed forces are to set up and operationalise 100 ‘selfie points’ under government-defined themes of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Sashaktikaran’, and send “action taken reports”.  The scheme, using the armed forces to promote and advertise government policies, has an obvious political purpose.  The selfie point at the National War Memorial. Civil-military relations  India’s armed forces are subordinate to control by the Union government of the day. However, the government should consult the service chiefs (or the Chief of Defence Staff) before issuing directions such as soldiers-on-leave “volunteering” to promote government schemes, or establish “selfie-points” for the same purpose, because they impact the soldier and the service. It will never be known whether the government consulted the four-star top brass, or if consulted, what they advised the government.  Even earlier, the four-star top brass had complied with directions to arrange yoga mats on Raj Path (2015) for the government to set a world record, and clear garbage thrown by Himalayan pilgrimage tourists (2017). Both these tasks were within the ambit of duty and competence of other agencies.   Getting soldiers to do such tasks indicates the government’s step-motherly attitude towards the armed forces. Other examples are: death and disability benefits to soldiers made lower than for their civilian counterparts; denying non-functional financial up-gradation (NFU) to the armed forces although the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) receive it; and delaying the payment of OROP arrears ordered by the Supreme Court.  Politicisation  It is the duty of military top brass to convince the political leadership to not pass orders which are political in nature and intent, or impact adversely on the soldier and the service, and thereby on national security. This is easier said than done in the best of times, but under the present dispensation, it is much more difficult. Notwithstanding the difficulty, when the military leadership fails, the armed forces get politicised by default.  The government’s “soldier-volunteer” and “selfie-point” initiatives for political purposes are measures which politicise the armed forces, since the government cannot be unaware of the Army Act and Army Rules, which prohibit political activity.  Senior military veterans have expressed concern about the deleterious long-term impact of politics on the morale and cohesion of our armed forces.  Central and state governments prepare development plans and schemes to benefit the people, but advertising them is the ruling party’s political agenda. Soldiers promoting government schemes is unambiguously political activity. When it is ordered by the highest military authority in compliance with government directives, it politicises the armed forces. The government would do well to cease using the Army for political purposes, and the military top brass would do well to maintain the apolitical nature of the soldier and the service, in the interest of national security.

https://thewire.in/security/two-kuki-men-killed-in-fresh-violence-in-manipur,Security,Two Kuki Men Killed in Fresh Violence in Manipur,"In Manipur’s Kangpokpi district, two individuals from the Kuki-Zo community succumbed to bullet injuries in the fresh violence that transpired on Monday (November 20). The deceased have been identified as Henminlen Vaiphei, son of Luntinlal Vaiphei, and Thangminlun Hangshing, son of Lunkhongam Hangshing. The Committee on Tribal Unity (COTU) issued a statement to the media, revealing that the incident occurred in the Kangchup area. Kuki-Zo village volunteers, patrolling the road between Leilon Vaiphei village and Kharam Vaiphei village, were allegedly ambushed by Meitei insurgents wearing state commandos’ uniforms. This case bears resemblance to a previous ambush in the Kangchup area, where three volunteers were killed allegedly by disguised Meitei militants on September 12. Responding to the escalating violence, COTU called for an emergency meeting on Monday, advocating for a shutdown in Kangpokpi district. According to COTU, the group responsible for the killings is the same group of disguised insurgents operating in Moreh, a border town in Tengnoupal district. COTU reported various alleged atrocities committed by this group, including looting church funds, burning vehicles, harassing women and children, and demolishing houses. A Manipur police officer overseeing the construction of a helipad in Moreh was shot dead on Tuesday, October 31, by suspected militants. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF) said that the deceased killed in the recent violence were repairing the Lamka-Kangpokpi road, damaged by the recent spell of rainfall. After dropping off their friends at a designated point, they were ambushed while attempting to return to Leimakhong, a mere 50 metres from where they left their friends. Since the victims and their friends were unarmed, they were unable to defend themselves. One of the deceased, Henminlen Vaiphei, served as personnel of 6th IRB, posted at Leimakhong. During The Wire’s visit to Churachandpur and Kangpokpi, it was observed that the roads were being repaired solely by the tribal community. With more than 200 deaths since May 3 in Manipur, Union home minister Amit Shah, who promised in June to visit the state after 15 days, is yet to fulfil that commitment. Meanwhile, the Manipur Police and central forces conducted a flag march in Tengnoupal, Kakching, Thoubal, and Imphal West District.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the Election Commission is an institution which has a great responsibility. So, if it is seen tilting, one way or the other, by even a very small degree, it can have great consequences for democracy,” Justice Banerjee, who recently retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya, told the newspaper. As the Chief Justice of Madras high court in April 2021, he hit out sharply at the authorities of the poll body for violating COVID-19 protocols during the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. Taking exception to his remarks, the poll body then moved the Supreme Court, but the court refused to expunge his remarks.

After about two years, he retired as Chief Justice of Meghalaya high court on November 1. Looking back at his remarks that supposedly led to his transfer in November 2021, Justice Banerjee said, “The case was being heard (in Madras HC) for a while and I felt there were some aberrations which is why those observations were made. Crowding in rallies and not following Covid protocol was certainly a concern and when the elections in West Bengal were held in eight phases, why was it held in a single phase in Tamil Nadu? You have to look at it in that context and not pick just two sentences.” He also went on to say, “Also, one cannot say that the court can’t make any observations. Lawyers cannot be expected to argue with a wall. They have to get indications from the bench so they can tailor their case accordingly.” Justice Banerjee said he is not concerned about what led to his transfer to Meghalaya high court. “I am sure there were cogent reasons for my transfer but I am not aware of it. I received an email (from then CJI N.V. Ramana’s office) and I said yes. Once you become a judge, you cannot have any ambitions of holding a particular office. So there was no question of me not consenting to the transfer.” His transfer was notified on November 9, 2021, by the Supreme Court Collegium, which said that a decision to that effect was taken on September 16, 2021. With no reason cited for his transfer by the Collegium, Justice said that the email he received from the CJI office only indicated that his transfer would be in the “interest of better administration of justice”. Justice Banerjee says he is least concerned about the reasons that led to his transfer. “But I would not have had it any other way. The work that happened in Meghalaya during my stint was very important. In my 11 months in Madras, I had very rewarding judicial work. But in Meghalaya, there wasn’t a lot of judicial work but we focused on infrastructure building.” Speaking of his stint at the Madras high court, he says that he never wanted to be a status quoist. “While the idea is that a Chief Justice who comes from outside takes a dispassionate view when it comes to appointments or other aspects, there is a flip side that they could end up being status quo-ists without wanting to ruffle too many feathers. By and large, the office of Chief Justice is considered a stepping stone for Supreme Court judgeship. It is to be somewhere but look elsewhere and not take steps to actively address the uncle-judge syndrome when it comes to appointments.” Justice Banerjee, who had been in the system for two decades, says that corruption in the higher judiciary worries him. “Punitive transfers are not enough. Corruption is an unimpeachable offence but it is difficult to gather evidence. These activities are not done in broad daylight but it is possible to collect some evidence of corruption. However, impeachment is a political solution. A compromised judge is convenient for all political parties. This is an aspect which erodes faith in the system and needs to be tackled.” Justice Banerjee enrolled as an advocate in November 1990 and began practicing principally in the Calcutta high court as well as the Supreme Court. He was elevated to the Bench as a judge in June 2006 and took over as chief justice of the Madras high court on January 4, 2021, before he was transferred to Meghalaya high court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/the-supreme-court-never-fails-to-disappoint,Law,The Supreme Court Never Fails to Disappoint,"If you’ve been a keen observer of the public discourse in India, you are probably immune to the bizarre and outlandish statements made by the worthies holding public office. Like the Scowling Sherpa’s revelation that “there is too much democracy” in India, or a minister in Davos claiming that high unemployment indicates self-employment, or the Supreme Leader’s assertion that not an inch of Indian land has been occupied by the Chinese, or a Minister for Human Resources in NDA I debunking Darwin’s theory by maintaining that none of his ancestors ever saw an ape turning into Homo sapiens. We are, of course, the swine who should be grateful for such pearls of wisdom, but two recent pearls, cultured in our very own fascist laboratory, have taken even my post-Diwali asthmatic breath away. Arguing for the government in the Supreme Court, the Attorney General made two astounding averments: one, that the voter does not have any right to know how his vote has been recorded or counted, and two, that the public does not have the right to know who has contributed how much to which political party.  The first statement was intended to counter the very legitimate demand for a more extensive VVPAT verification of the votes cast in the EVMs, the second was in response to the challenge to the electoral bonds, which have effectively become the BJP’s private ATM. We have never been in doubt that these statements are a faithful expression of the BJP’s private views, but the sheer brazenness of declaring it openly ― and in court! ― is mind-blowing. It is beyond arrogance and hubris, it shows utter contempt for the public, the constitution and (dare I say it?) even for the highest court. Translated into language which we porkers can understand, the government is actually saying: we will have our way, we don’t give a tinker’s cuss for what the citizenry thinks or what the court decides; we have the majority in Parliament (even if Mahua Moitra and her Louis Vuitton bags are not expelled) and can pass any ordinance or Bill we are inclined to. Misplaced confidence and hubris, did you say? You would be wrong, dear reader, because past events have proved that they are right. The judiciary has never been an obstacle to the ruling party’s rampaging depredation of our social, constitutional, legal and institutional landscape. One cannot help feeling that the government’s impudence is due in no small measure to the court’s accommodating and obliging behaviour. The Supreme Court never fails to disappoint, like on the petition for legalising same sex marriages, and on Manish Sisodia’s bail application. These were vehemently opposed by the government. Both were dismissed, quite against the run of play. Both judgments came as a surprise, not only because of their inherent contradictions, but also because in comments, the court had appeared to favour the petitioners’ cause. The order in the same sex marriage case is retrogressive and mired in a medieval mindset, which exposes the court’s disconnect with a rapidly changing social order. By refusing to legalise same sex marriages, or allowing same sex couples to adopt or giving them civil rights as a couple, the court may have warmed the cockles of the BJP/RSS heart but it has also given a thumbs up to obscurantist forces. By directing the government to set up a committee under the Cabinet Secretary to examine conferring more rights on queer people, the court is displaying its naivete, or deliberately deluding itself: does it really expect an officer who is on extension in service and who has been party to every unilateral and illiberal  decision taken by the present regime, to propose any expansion of the rights of this section, which this government is vociferously opposed to? The logic in the Manish Sisodia case is even more difficult to comprehend. The court had time and again castigated the prosecution for lack of evidence. It had even said that there was no money trail to link Sisodia with any bribe, and that the ED’s case would collapse during trial. And yet, it denied him bail. This can only encourage the government to lock up more people, confident that the courts will not offer bail. Clearly, this order is based more on presumption than on solid evidence. Also read: The Real Mystery of the Manish Sisodia Case Is the Supreme Court’s About-Face The electoral bonds question was taken up after five years, the delay allowing the BJP to mop up almost Rs 5,500 crore, more than all other parties combined. The court concluded hearings and reserved its order more than two weeks ago, again giving the BJP the opportunity to open the window for another tranche this week. This will enable it to secure all the donations it needs for the 2024 elections: whatever the court now decides will be irrelevant for the coming general elections. In the Maharashtra case between the two Shiv Sena factions, the Speaker continues to ignore, if not defy, the SC’s repeated orders for a quick decision. The Speaker has been given a long rope that he is using to strangle whatever vestiges of democracy remain. The Article 370 case similarly hangs in limbo, the orders reserved, and democracy continues to elude Jammu and Kashmir. The Bilkis Bano case has disappeared from the radar, if not the court’s registry. Whatever happened to the Pegasus Committee report, or SEBI’s investigation into the Adani conglomerate? With every day’s delay in deciding such crucial cases, or in delivering reserved orders, the status quo (which can only favour the government of the day) becomes a fait accompli, all the more difficult to reverse. It emboldens the government to continue with its bulldozer tactics, and to take the court for granted. Which is why the Attorney General can make the kind of statements he does and continue cocking a snook at the court. Earlier this month, he even cautioned the court not to cross its limits, when the CJI fixed December 31 as the deadline for the Maharashtra Speaker to decide the MLAs’ disqualification case! It may be that the court wishes to avoid a confrontation with the executive, and therefore “urges” when it should direct, or “requests” when it should mandate, or “persuades” when it should command. But such a timid approach is not working; it takes two to avoid a clash, and this government is perpetually in adversarial mode. Moreover, it also reduces the majesty of the law and dilutes the credibility of legal institutions in the eyes of the citizenry. We need the court to administer the law without fear or favour, to practise within the court what it preaches in keynote speeches. We need less rhetoric, obiter dicta and moral grandstanding from the judiciary and more concern for foundational freedoms and rights, stern messaging to the government, and imposition of consequences for defying orders. ‘Stooping to conquer’ may be an interesting phrase for an Oliver Goldsmith play, but entirely inappropriate for our current political environment; the phrase ‘flattering to deceive’ may describe it better?

LiveLaw has reported that a bench of Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra took a dim view of the state’s governors having withheld his assent to 10 bills, over which the apex court issued notice on the Tamil Nadu government’s writ petition on November 10. On November 13, the governor now, R.N. Ravi, disposed of the bills. The court had said that this was a matter of serious concern. “Mr Attorney, the Governor says he has disposed of these bills on November 13. Our concern is that our order was passed on November 10. These bills have been pending since January 2020. It means that the Governor took the decision after the Court issued notice. What was the Governor doing for three years? Why should the Governor wait for the parties to approach the Supreme Court?”, the CJI asked Attorney General for India R. Venkataramani, according to LiveLaw. Venkataramani said that these bills concern the governor’s powers and seek to strip the governor of the power to appoint vice-chancellors in state universities. The bench repeated that the “oldest of the pending bills was sent to the governor in January 2020,” the report said. The current governor, R.N. Ravi, who is locked in a tussle with the state government, assumed power on November 2021, something the AG said in court too. “The issue is not whether any particular governor delayed but whether in general there has been a delay in exercising constitutional functions,” the bench said. The bench adjourned the hearing till December 1 after learning that the Tamil Nadu assembly re-adopted these bills in the assembly. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who is part of the Tamil Nadu government’s counsel, said that 15 bills are now pending before the governor now. These, include the initial 10. Ravi, as Tamil Nadu governor, has openly gone against the M.K. Stalin-led government in various ways recently – by not reading out the version of the governor’s speech in the state assembly that had been agreed upon by his office and the chief minister’s office earlier this year, and then in ‘dismissing’ arrested minister V. Senthil Balaji. The Deccan Herald, in its editorial, has questioned Ravi’s delay and called for this removal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/criminal-law-bills-explained-g-mohan-gopal,Law,Watch: 'Three Criminal Law Bills Will Establish Permanent Extra-Constitutional Emergency Powers',"On August 11, 2023 the Union Government introduced three new Bills in the Lok Sabha to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill) the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam Bill) and the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill). G. Mohan Gopal, advocate in the Supreme Court of India and a legal academician, sits down to discuss the changes being brought through these bills and what they imply for the criminal justice system. He says that while quantitatively, the bills only change some 20%-25% of the law in the three current statutes; what is crucial and requires very close public attention, are a dozen chilling changes to the law that have the potential to liquidate liberty, decimate democracy and fundamentally change the face of our polity from democratic to authoritarian should the government decide to deploy any or all of these changes to their fullest extent.

https://thewire.in/law/fahad-shah-jammu-kashmir-high-court-order,Law,'Would Literally Turn Criminal Law on its Head': What J&K HC Said While Granting Fahad Shah Bail,"Punching holes in the police chargesheet, the Jammu and Kashmir high court has struck down the terror funding charge against Kashmiri journalist Fahad Shah while linking the ‘seditious’ article in his media outlet to the fundamental right to freedom of speech. The court granted bail to Shah on November 17, nearly two years after he was first arrested by J&K Police on terrorism charges. Hearing his bail application, a division bench of the high court observed that invoking charges of terrorism against Shah for an 11-year-old article “collide(s) head long with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19 of the Constitution.” ‘The shackles of slavery will break’, the controversial article authored by Aala Fazili, a University of Kashmir scholar, appeared in The Kashmir Walla outlet, which was founded by Shah, in 2011. Both Aala and Shah were arrested last year in the anti-terror case which was filed in Jammu CIJ police station by J&K Police’s State Investigation Agency (SIA). Shah’s bail application was earlier rejected by a lower court. The SIA has accused the two of glorifying terrorism, terror conspiracy and waging war against the country besides a slew of other charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA) and Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). The prosecution had invoked Section 43-D (5) of the UAPA to oppose Shah’s bail application. Under this section, a court cannot grant bail to a UAPA suspect without hearing the prosecution. Opposing the bail application, the prosecution pleaded that the controversial article in The Kashmir Walla was a ‘terrorist attack’ defined in section 15 (1) (a) (ii) of the UAPA. The prosecution claimed that the article had attacked the “honour, dignity and fair name” of India which was her “incorporeal” property under section 2 (h) of the UAPA. Argument ‘would literally turn criminal law on its head’ Rejecting the prosecution’s argument that the anti-terror case was beyond the high court’s purview at this stage as charges have been framed by the trial court, the HC bench of Justice Mohan Lal and Justice Atul Sreedharan observed that a “superficial analysis of … evidence was necessary” to decide Shah’s bail application “more so in a case where the bar of section 43-D (5) is raised.” Dismissing the prosecution’s argument that the publication of the article was a terrorist attack on India, the division bench observed: “If this argument is accepted, it would literally turn criminal law on its head. It would mean that any criticism of the central government can be described as a terrorist act because the honour of India is its incorporeal property.” The bench continued: “The legislature would have to make the act of expressing, in any manner whatsoever, a disparaging thought of India, a specific offence. The average Indian in the street who must suffer the consequences must be made well aware beforehand that his negative opinion of India, expressed in words or in writing or any other form giving permanence, could visit him with severe sanction.” Delving into the definition of terrorism and terrorist activities under the UAPA, the court pointed out that the prosecution has not provided any evidence of violence or attack on security forces due to the publication of the controversial article. ‘Prima facie at fault for his mental state’ Referring to a news report in The Kashmir Walla which had mentioned the last phone conversation of a militant before his killing in Shopian district on April 11, 2021 and which, the prosecution alleged, glorified violence, the court held that the report is based on facts which “neither endorses the sentiments of the militant and neither (sic) does it glorify the militant.” During the arguments, the prosecution also told the court that some unpublished poems recovered during searches at Shah’s home and office showed his “separatist mentality” but the court observed that these “reflect his fondness for the valley and freedom, as also his pain and anguish at the turmoil” in J&K. “The prosecution wants the court to hold the appellant prima facie at fault for his mental state,” the court pointed out dryly. In its chargesheet filed last year, the SIA, J&K’s elite counterterrorism agency which was formed in the aftermath of the reading down of Article 370, had also sought to link the recent protests and militancy-related incidents in Kashmir to the article which, the agency said, also led to the radicalisation of Kashmiri youngsters. The court had framed charges against Shah in March this year. According to the charge sheet, the article was allegedly part of a “secessionist-cum terrorist campaign” to incite the youth of Jammu and Kashmir into adopting “violent means of protest to secede from India and accede to Pakistan.” Earlier, senior advocate and Shah’s counsel, P.N. Raina, informed the bench that none of the 44 witnesses listed in the charge sheet or documents collected as evidence during the course of investigation by the SIA suggest that the article had influenced people to take up arms or resort to violence. ‘Stretching causation to absurd limits’ The court ruled that there was no reference to the accession of J&K with Pakistan in the article nor any call to arms, “There is no incitement to violence of any kind much less acts of terrorism or of undermining the authority of the State with acts of violence,” the bench pointed out. It added: “It cannot be presumed reasonably that the instances of stone pelting that may have taken place in 2022 were on account of the instigation of the offending article that was uploaded in the year 2011.” Invoking the Latin maxim ‘causa proxima non remota jura spectatoror’, the court observed that the “proximate cause” of the article was important to fix liability. “Affixing liability for the offences between 2020 to 2022 based on the article written and published in 2011 would be stretching causation to absurd limits,” the bench noted. According to the SIA chargesheet, Shah has received funding of Rs 95 lakh for ‘The Kashmir Walla’ since its inception which, the agency said, could have been allegedly used for terror activities. However, the HC observed that the trial court has framed charges of FCRA violation against Shah and not section 17 of the UAPA which deals with punishment for terror funding. “The apprehension sounded by the State that the funds received by the Appellant which includes overseas remittances could have been used for terror funding is summarily rejected,” the bench ruled. Two questions At the outset of the bail order, the division bench pointed out that it was mulling over two questions; one, whether section 43-D (5) of the UAP Act where, despite the existence of a prima facie case, the absence of a ‘Need to Arrest’ would violate the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution” and, the court continued, “if it does, whether the Court can still grant bail on account of the violation of Article 21?” The court added on the second question: “And whether, the concept of ‘Clear and Present Danger’ ought to be taken into account by the Courts while deciding a bail application where the bar under section 43-D (5) is applicable?” In this instance, the court ruled that the prosecution has not been able to prove the charge of ‘clear and present danger’ against Shah while granting him bail. The court has quashed the charges under Sections 18 (terror conspiracy) and 121 (waging war against the country) of the UAP Act and 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code against Shah, setting the stage for his release from jail where he has been held for nearly two years. “He (Shah) will face trial under Section 13 (abetting unlawful activities) of the UAPA and Sections 35 (receiving foreign funds illegally) and 39 (offences by companies) under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010,” Raina, his counsel, told The Wire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/union-to-sc-28-states-uts-appoint-nodal-officers-to-tackle-hate-speech-under-2018-guidelines,Law,Union to SC: ‘28 States/UTs Appoint Nodal Officers to Tackle Hate Speech Under 2018 Guidelines’,"New Delhi: The Union government has informed the Supreme Court that 28 states have appointed nodal officers in accordance with the guidelines issued by the court during the ‘Tehseen Poonawalla‘ case to prevent mob violence and lynching in 2018. The status report was filed by the Union in response to a batch of petitions seeking directions to curb hate speech, LiveLaw reported. On August 25, while hearing these petitions, the apex court had asked the home ministry to collate information from states regarding the appointment of nodal officers and file a status report within three weeks. It had also said that if any state government does not furnish said details, then the top court should be apprised of that. In 2018, the Supreme Court had recommended the Parliament create a special law against lynching, emphasising that “fear of law and veneration for the command of law constitute the foundation of a civilised society”. The court had also issued a series of directions to prevent mob lynching, including the mandate for appointing nodal officers in every district across the country. Watch: Why Doesn’t the Government Have Separate Mob Lynching Data? However, the apex court had pulled up the Union and 10 state governments in 2019 for not implementing the directions issued by it to curb mob lynching and violence, The Wire had reported. In August, 2023, after emphasising on the importance of stakeholder collaboration to address the issue of hate speech, the court proposed its own plan. It suggested the formation of a committee led by the district police chief. This committee would evaluate both the content and accuracy of hate speech complaints and provide specific directions to the investigating officer or the chief of the jurisdictional police station. The committee would be required to meet within a specified time period after being apprised of a case as well as periodically review the progress in all ongoing cases according to the suggestions floated by the bench, the LiveLaw report said. Meanwhile, the court allowed the petitioners facing grievances to simultaneously seek assistance from the nodal police officers appointed as per the 2018 judgement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chandrababu Naidu Bail in Skill Development Case,"New Delhi: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday (November 20) granted regular bail to former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu in the skill development scam case. Justice T. Mallikarjun Rao said, according to LiveLaw, that from the material on the record, it cannot be definitively concluded that the misappropriated amounts were diverted to the Telugu Desam Party’s bank accounts. The judge said: “The petitioner, A.37, was arrested on September 9, 2023, and remained in judicial custody until being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders. Despite allegations of transferring misappropriated amounts to the T.D.P. party’s account, no prima facie evidence is presented to support this claim. This court views that such serious allegations should be backed by substantial material before seeking the remand of the petitioner. The court, at this point, views the lack of supportive material as a gap in the investigation’s conclusion that the alleged misappropriated amount had been transferred to the T.D.P. party’s account.” The court also noted that Naidu could not be held responsible for all the discrepancies noted in the forensic audit report as per which out of the Rs 371 crore, at least Rs 241 crore were misappropriated by SISW and Design Tech and diverted to various shell companies. “The Prosecution needs to clarify how the petitioner can be held responsible for such discrepancies, as it is not his duty, as the then Chief Minister, to verify and compare parties’ signatures…It remains to be clarified how the differences outlined in the report can be deemed the fundamental cause for the alleged misappropriation of funds,” the judge noted. Earlier on October 31, the court had granted Naidu four weeks’ medical bail. He had been arrested by the CID on September 9 and has been in the Rajahmundry central prison since September 10. The CID has listed Naidu as ‘accused number one’ in the alleged skill development scam. He is charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, breach of trust, destruction of evidence, and abetment. The South First has reported that the scam is allegedly a Rs 279-crore one. The news outlet has also reported on Andhra Pradesh CID chief N Sanjay’s run-ins with Naidu’s kin. TDP leaders Kaluva Srinivasulu, Bhuma Brahmananda Reddy, A.V. Subba Reddy, B.C. Janardhan Reddy and Akhila Priya were also arrested on the same day. Naidu has claimed that this case is an act of political vendetta against him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to LiveLaw, the petition was filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari, one of the individuals who filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a court-monitored inquiry into the allegations levelled against the conglomerate by US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research. Tiwari highlighted that according to the May 17 order of the top court, SEBI was required to submit its report by August 14. However, the market regulator has not yet presented its final report. The lawyer sought a directive asking SEBI to explain its non-compliance and also the initiation of contempt proceedings against the regulator. He also drew attention to the investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which also accused Adani Group companies of irregularities. The Supreme Court-appointed expert committee should also investigate the OCCRP report, Tiwari sought. According to LiveLaw, while the scheduled hearing into the matter was on August 29, 2023, the case has not yet been listed in the Supreme Court. Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan had raised the matter before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud on November 6, expressing urgency. The CJI assured that the issue would be examined with the registry. The original two-month deadline set by the Supreme Court to investigate the allegations raised by Hindenburg ended on May 2. SEBI requested an extension, citing the complexity of transactions and the need for additional time, and was granted time until August 14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/is-there-life-after-electoral-bonds,Law,Is There Life After Electoral Bonds?,"Though introduced in 2017, Electoral Bonds (EBs) seem to have become a popular topic in the national discourse ever since the recent three-day hearing in the Supreme Court (SC). There has been fair bit of writing in the print and digital media, and also some discussion on TV. In quite a few of media writings suggestions have been given on how to make EBs less opaque or confidential (as the Solicitor General of India kept insisting during the SC hearings). Quite a few correspondents/reporters have also asked me to specifically comment on how to make EBs “acceptable”. That is what prompts the title of this piece. A lot of us seem to have forgotten that political parties, elections and democracy existed even before 2017, i.e., before the introduction of EBs. Existence of political parties implies that parties got money to conduct their affairs including contesting elections, and there was no mystery where and how they got the money and from whom. There were several methods of political parties getting money such as (a) by cheque, (b) by bank draft, (c) by digital transfer through banks, (d) digital payment through apps, (e) Electoral Trusts, and (f) cash, with each donation being not more than Rs 2,000. The most popular method, of course, was cash in unlimited amounts. Also read: How Two IAS Officers Chaperoned the Electoral Bonds Bill Despite RBI’s Objections The only complication was, and still is, that there was no incontrovertible proof of the transactions by the last, and the most common, method and therefore no one except the giver and the receiver knew how much money was given by whom and to whom. Some insiders and snoopers were of course, the expected exceptions. Consequently, it was not possible for people at large to know whether decisions by a particular political party in power, in the Centre of any of the States, were motivated by welfare of the people at large or for the benefit of a donor of a large amount of unaccounted cash. We also need to remember that donations need not be strictly only in cash, they can also be in kind such as making aircraft or helicopters booked in the name of some company or individual, being provided to a political party for its use. Though the Union of India has claimed during the hearings in the SC that ever since EBs were introduced that transparency of electoral funding has improved, the statement made above – “no one except the giver and the receiver knew how much money was given by whom and to whom” – is still valid with a very interesting change. Going strictly according to the EBs scheme as announced by the government, not even the receiver may know who has given the money! This of course is creative imagination of the highest order as everyone knows that one who gives money always makes sure the receiver knows who is the giver. The pious concept of gupt-daan (anonymous donation) does not apply to political donations. What can, and should, the Supreme Court do? I will refrain from suggesting what the SC should do because the judgment is reserved, but being part of one of the petitioner-organisations, what we have requested the SC to do is to declare Sections 135, 137, 11 and 154 of the Finance Act 2017 and consequential amendments in Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India 1934, Section 29C of the Representation of the People Act 1951, Section 13A of the Income Tax Act 1961, and Section 182 of the Companies Act 2013; and Section 236 of Finance Act 2016 and consequential amendments in Section 2(1)(j)(vi) of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010 “as being unconstitutional, null and void”. What this legal jargon means is that, in effect, we have requested the SC to declare the Electoral Bonds scheme as unconstitutional or illegal, or in even simpler words to strike it down. And of course, this is what we would like the SC to do. The other issue – “What can the SC do?” – is, I think, more important and needs some comment. A lot of commentary has suggested that the SC should make some modifications in the EBs scheme to remove what has been variously called as “selective disclosure’, “selective or partial transparency” and of course the celebrated “partial confidentiality”. It is necessary to go to some basics in order to resolve this issue of “What can the SC do?”. Under the principle of separation of powers, the three pillars of the State – the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – have separate and distinct powers. In simple terms, the prime function of the legislature is to make laws, the prime function of the executive is to implement laws, and the prime function of the judiciary is to interpret laws. The power to interpret laws implies and includes the power of judicial review. This power of judicial review implies that the higher judiciary, the Supreme Court and the high courts have the power to review any action of the legislature and the executive and decide whether these actions are in keeping with the Constitution of India or not, and if they find any of the actions not to be in line with the Constitution, the Supreme Court and the high courts have the power to declare any such action as unconstitutional. That is why in our petition we have requested the SC to declare the above-mentioned laws as “unconstitutional, null and void”. Also read: Time to Shut the Floodgates of Secret Political Party Funding I maintain that all that the SC can do is to declare these laws as unconstitutional and no more. While many of the suggestions that have been, and are still being made, about what the SC should do, are valuable but they are all outside the remit of the SC. What must be remembered is that laws can be made only by the legislature. Yes, the SC can certainly make suggestions, if it wishes to do that, but it cannot, in my view, make modifications to the scheme as enunciated by the government and passed by the Parliament. As an aside, the passing of the EBs scheme by the Parliament is also in doubt because it was included in a Money Bill, thus disabling the Rajya Sabha from making changes to it but that issue is being examined by a separate constitutional bench of seven judges and was therefore not argued before the current bench of five judges. At the end of the day, we just have to wait and see what the SC does. Jagdeep S. Chhokar is a concerned citizen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/jk-high-court-quashes-psa-proceedings-against-sajad-gul-rebukes-admin-for-not-applying-its-mind,Law,"J&K High Court Quashes PSA Proceedings Against Sajad Gul, Rebukes Admin for ‘Not Applying Its Mind'","New Delhi: Terming the arbitrary jailing of government critics as an “abuse of preventive law”, a Jammu and Kashmir high court bench headed by Chief Justice K. Kotiswar Singh has quashed the Public Safety Act (PSA) proceedings against Kashmiri journalist Sajad Gul. Rapping the J&K administration for “not applying its mind” while approving the PSA proceedings against Gul, the court observed that there was “no specific allegation” in the PSA dossier to suggest that Gul’s activities were “prejudicial to the security of the state”. The court directed the administration to release Gul “forthwith from preventive custody if not required in any other case.” Gul was already in police custody for his alleged involvement in three FIRs filed by J&K Police when the District Magistrate of Bandipora approved his detention (No. 25/DMB/PSA of 2021-22) under the Public Safety Act on January 14, 2022. Gul was consequently shifted to Central Jail, Jammu, some 350 km from his home. While quashing the PSA proceedings on November 9, the bench observed that the “tendency…. to detain the critics of the policies or commissions/omissions of the government machinery, as in the case of the present detenu– a professional media person, … is an abuse of the preventive law.” Also read: After Nearly 2 Years, J&K HC Grants Bail to Kashmiri Journalist Fahad Shah Under PSA, described by Amnesty International as a “lawless law”, a suspect can be detained without charges and put behind bars without trial for up to two years. The bench ruled that the grounds of detention in Gul’s PSA dossier don’t indicate that he was involved in any wrongdoing. “It is nowhere stated as to how the detenu had disrupted the public order creating any alleged enmity, inasmuch as, there is no specific instance in any of the allegations levelled against him to show that he had been working against the national interests.” While the administration, without citing any instances in the PSA dossier, had termed Gul as a “negative critic” who allegedly provoked people against the government policies through his tweets and news items, the bench observed that factual reporting by media can’t be held against the journalists who report on such issues. Gul was working as a trainee reporter with the now defunct The Kashmir Walla when he was detained under PSA, “There is no specific instance (in the PSA dossier) as to which of the posts/write-ups (of Gul) are there as being so (create enmity against government) and on what date.” Earlier, senior advocate Nazir Ahmad Ronga and Tuba Manzoor, counsels for Gul, told the court that he could not make a meaningful representation against his detention as he was not provided the PSA dossier, FIRs, statements of witnesses and other documents which the authorities “relied upon” to book him under the PSA “and, as such, (he) has been deprived  of his constitutional and legal right.” Citing a Supreme Court judgement, the court observed that the denial of documents to Gul and his continued detention “becomes illegal and detention order has to be quashed on that ground alone.” “In absence of providing of the whole of the documentary record, the detenu cannot be said to be able to make an effective and meaningful representation against his detention which was his statutory as well as constitutional right,” the court ruled. Earlier, a single bench of HC had dismissed a Habeas Corpus petition filed by Gul against his PSA detention order on December 1, 2022. Also read: ‘Deprived of Rights, Non-Application of Mind’: J&K HC Tears Into PSA Proceedings Against Fahad Shah Gul has also been booked by J&K Police in FIR No 12/2021 filed by Hajin Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 336 (endangering human life), 447 (punishment for criminal trespassing), and 353 (assaulting public servant) in the aftermath of an anti-encroachment drive. On February 9, 2019, Gul reported that a local tehsildar was “harassing and threatening” locals while conducting anti-encroachment drive. The next day, the tehsildar allegedly targeted Gul and his relatives’ houses in his native Shahgund village without serving any notice. This triggered protests and minor clashes between locals and officials in the area. The Hajin Police Station had booked Gul in a second case (FIR No 79/2021) on October 16, 2021 under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 505 (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code following his report on the killing of a local militant in Bandipora’s Gund Jahangeer village The police accused him of “spreading false and fake narrative” of the anti-insurgency operation. However, a court granted him bail in this case. The third case (FIR No 02/2022) against Gul was filed under sections 147, 148 (armed with weapon that can cause death), 336 , 307 (attempt to murder) and 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the IPC. The case was filed after Gul posted a video clip on social media which showed some unidentified women shouting “anti-national slogans” at the house of Saleem Parrey, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, in the aftermath of his killing in an encounter by security forces. The quashing of the PSA proceedings against Gul came ahead of the high court’s decision to grant bail to The Kashmir Walla editor Fahad Shah who had been languishing in jail since February 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/after-nearly-2-years-jk-hc-grants-bail-to-kashmir-walla-editor-fahad-shah,Law,"After Nearly 2 Years, J&K HC Grants Bail to Kashmiri Journalist Fahad Shah","New Delhi: Nearly two years after his arrest, the Jammu and Kashmir high court has set the stage for the release of Kashmiri journalist Fahad Shah by granting him bail on Friday, November 17, in a case involving the publication of a “seditious” article in his digital magazine. Shah was held on charges of terrorism for publishing the article, ‘The shackles of slavery will break’, in his now-defunct magazine, The Kashmir Walla, in 2011. The opinion piece was authored by Aala Fazili, a University of Kashmir scholar who has also been arrested in the case. Shah’s counsel and senior advocate P.N. Raina said that the court quashed the charges under Sections 18 (terror conspiracy) and 121 (waging war against the country) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the Indian Penal Code against Shah. “He (Shah) will face trial under Section 13 (abetting unlawful activities) of the UAPA and Sections 35 (receiving foreign funds illegally) and 39 (offences by companies) under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010,” Raina told The Wire. The case was filed by J&K’s State Investigation Agency at the CIJ police station in Jammu on April 4, 2022 (FIR No: 01/2022), around 11 years after Fazili’s piece appeared in the magazine. A chargesheet was filed in the case last year in March. In April this year, the high court had quashed the Public Safety Act (PSA) invoked against Shah by terming the allegations of the J&K administration as “mere surmise” and “vague and bald assertions”. It also accused the authorities of snatching Shah’s “constitutional and legal rights”. According to Amnesty International, the PSA is a “lawless law”, which has been used as a “revolving door” policy for suspects against whom the government in Jammu and Kashmir has little or no evidence to bring formal charges against them in the court of law. Shah’s PSA dossier, accessed by The Wire, alleged that he was “filled with hatred against [the] Union of India”, and “promoted separatism”. It further alleged that his “activities seem to be prejudicial to the sovereignty, security, integrity, peace and tranquility of the UT of J&K and also the Union of India”. The dossier also accused Shah of arranging “logistical support for anti-national activities” and “inciting violence thereby leading to disturbance in public order” while terming him as a “threat to public order.” After the court quashed the PSA proceedings against him, Shah was arrested by J&K’s State Investigation Agency in the case in which he has now been granted bail. He has been granted bail in three other criminal cases brought against him by J&K Police for the reporting done by his magazine on Kashmir. Shah was charged for the first time in May 2020 over the coverage of a gun battle between militants and security forces in Srinagar. In the encounter’s aftermath, local residents had alleged that security forces took away their precious belongings, a charge denied by them. The allegations and the denial were widely reported by local and national media. Then on January 30, 2021, Shah was booked under Sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot) and 505 (statements conducive to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code for a report in The Kashmir Walla, which alleged that the Army was “pressuring” the management of a private school in Shopian to organise the Republic Day celebrations. The Army had denied the charge and proceeded to file a criminal case against Shah, who was later granted bail by a court. Shah has reportedly faced six cases of intimidation between June 2017 and January 2021. The third case pertains to the The Kashmir Walla’s coverage of a gun battle in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district in which three militants, including a top commander, were gunned down last year. The Kashmir Walla was accused of “glorifying terrorist activities” and causing “disaffection against the country” by alleged “incorrect reporting”. On August 19 this year, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology pulled down The Kashmir Walla website under the provisions of the Information and Technology Act, 2000, a controversial law which has been criticised by the free speech activists. Press freedom in India has suffered relentless blows in recent years under the Narendra Modi government. According to the World Press Freedom Index’s latest report, India slipped to 161 out of 180 countries this year, losing 11 more spots as compared to the 2022 ranking. According to Paris-based press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders, India has been using “charges of defamation, sedition, contempt of court and endangering national security … increasingly .. against journalists critical of the government, who are branded as ‘anti-national’.” The government has denied these charges, accusing the watchdog of “subverting the democratic freedoms all over the world”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/government/what-parl-panel-said-on-bharatiya-sakshya-bill-which-seeks-to-replace-the-indian-evidence-act,Government,"What Parliament Panel Said on Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, Which Seeks To Replace Indian Evidence Act","New Delhi: While the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides for “any information” that is given electronically as oral evidence, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, tasked with examining the proposed legislation, has recommended the deletion of these words, saying that this could cause serious complications in its interpretations. The committee has also cautioned against the tampering of evidence and recommended “safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of electronic and digital records acquired during the course of investigation.” The Bill, along with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1870) and the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023, (which seeks to replace the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973), was referred to the 31-member committee after it was introduced in parliament on August 11 by Union home minister Amit Shah. The committee adopted its report last week. In their dissent notes, opposition MPs have criticised these Bills for being “copy-paste” legislations and flagged drafting errors and the haste with which they are being pushed through. The Wire analyses the main recommendations of the committee report on the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023. “Any information” given electronically The Bill defines evidence as oral and documentary. Oral evidence includes “statements or any information given electronically which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses in relation to matters of fact under inquiry and such statements or information”, while it defines documentary evidence as documents, “including electronic or digital records produced for the inspection of the court.” In the Bill, the definition of “documents” has been expanded to include electronic or digital records on emails, server logs, documents on computers, laptop or smartphone, messages, websites, locational evidence and voice mail messages stored on digital devices. The definition of “evidence” has been expanded to include any information given electronically, which will enable the appearance of witnesses, accused, experts and victims through electronic means. The committee in its report said that it was brought to its attention during deliberations that the inclusion of the words “any information” within the meaning of evidence could cause serious complications in its interpretations, and that the word “information” is different from statements. The committee has recommended that the words “any information” be deleted. “The committee opines that inclusion of ‘any information’ along with ‘statement’ in the same line may cause complications in its interpretation. The committee, therefore, recommends that the words ‘any information’ may be deleted in this clause to avoid such complications,” it said. Also read: No Handcuffs for Economic Offences, Digital Evidence ‘Safeguards’: Parliamentary Panel Report on BNSS Bill Safeguarding electronic and digital evidence against tampering The committee has also recommended the need to safeguard the authenticity of electronic and digital records acquired during investigation against tampering. It said that Clause 57 provides for treating electronic and digital records produced from proper custody as primary evidence, but does not mention about ensuring proper chain of custody of such digital and electronic records. “The provision of maintaining proper chain of custody has already been incorporated within the ambit of criminal laws in developed countries such as the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK).” It recommended that that proper chain of custody needs to be maintained to avoid tampering during the handling of evidence. “The committee is of the opinion that safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of electronic and digital records acquired during the course of investigation is crucial due to the fact that such evidences are prone to tampering,” it said. “The committee takes into account the suggestion submitted before the committee and recommends that a provision may be inserted to mandate that all electronic and digital records acquired as evidence during the course of investigation are securely handled and processed through proper chain of custody. Appropriate provision in this regard may be made in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.” Also read: In ‘Interest of Gender Neutrality’, Parl Panel Recommends Keeping Section 377, Criminalising Adultery Drafting and cross-referencing errors In addition, the committee has also noted a number of drafting errors in various clauses and recommended their rectifications. It also found several cross-referencing errors in different clauses in the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023. “The committee also undertook a detailed examination of the text of each clause and noted that the Bill contains some cross-referencing errors. The committee, therefore, recommends the ministry to rectify such errors,” it said. The committee concluded that the changes brought in the Bill would “reflect the growing importance of digital evidence” and the need for a more comprehensive legal framework in line with 21st century technological advancements and societal changes.

https://thewire.in/government/no-handcuffs-for-economic-offences-safeguards-electronic-evidence-misuse-parl-panel-report-on-bns,Government,"No Handcuffs for Economic Offences, Digital Evidence 'Safeguards': Parliamentary Panel Report on BNSS Bill","New Delhi: No handcuffing for economic offences, ‘robust safeguards’ against misuse of electronic evidence, and clarity around police detention beyond 15 days – these are some of the recommendations that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs has made in its report on the proposed legislation, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023, which seeks to replace the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The Bill, along with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Penal Code, 1870) and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam Bill (which seeks to replace the Indian Evidence Act, 1872), was introduced in parliament on August 11 by Union home minister Amit Shah. They were then referred to the 31-member Parliamentary Standing Committee, headed by BJP MP Brij Lal. The panel adopted its report last week. The Wire analyses the recommendations and observations of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill. No handcuffs for economic offences While the Supreme Court in an order in 1980 had said that handcuffs are against human dignity, the Bill provides for its use under clause 43(3) for certain offences. Opposition MPs in their dissent note had also flagged the return of the use of handcuffs and said that the Section was in line with the “colonial mindset of punitive control of state”. In its report, however, the parliamentary panel has not objected to its use, except in the case of economic offences. “The committee believes that the use of handcuffs, as outlined in Clause 43(3), is appropriately restricted to select heinous crimes, which is necessary for preventing the escape of individuals accused of serious offences and ensuring the safety of police officers and staff during arrests,” it said. “However, the committee is of the view that ‘economic offences’ should not be included in this category. This is because the term ‘economic offences’ encompasses a wide range of offences, ranging from petty to serious, and therefore, it may not be suitable for blanket application of handcuffing in all cases falling under this category. The committee, therefore, recommends that Clause 43(3) may be suitably amended to delete the words ‘economic offences’ from the clause.” Safeguards against misuse of electronic evidence While the Bill advocates for the increasing utilisation of technology, the parliamentary panel report, however, cautions against electronic data usage without safeguards. The Bill says that trials, inquiries, proceedings can be held in electronic mode, along with the production of electronic communication devices (such as mobiles, computers, etc.), for potential digital evidence for investigation, inquiry or trial. The panel report said that “while the increased utilisation of technology offers numerous advantages, it also creates opportunities for manipulation and misuse.” It also said that the collection and storage of electronic evidence raises “concerns about data security and the possibility of unauthorised breaches” and has called for “robust safeguards” against it. “The committee, therefore, recommends that the adoption of electronic means for communication and trials should proceed only after the establishment of robust safeguards to ensure the secure usage and authentication of electronically available data. This will help safeguard the integrity of the justice system and ensure that justice is administered fairly and accurately,” it said. It has also said that while enabling online/electronic FIR registration is a positive step forward in the proposed legislation, it feels that such online/electronic registration should be allowed only through modes specified by the State. The committee also said that while the Bill provides for formal adoption of audio-visual and electronic means to undertake various processes, a clause may be inserted for facilitating audio-video recording of evidence of defence, after ensuring proper safeguards. It said that to avoid the possibility of tutoring or intimidation of witnesses, such recording should only be allowed at select government places. Need clarity on the extended period of police custody The panel has also sought greater clarity on the issue of the increased period of police custody, an issue that had been raised by the opposition MPs in their dissent notes. The MPs had referred to Clause 187 that allows the magistrate to increase the period of police custody beyond 15 days under certain circumstances, and said that increasing the period of police custody without proper safeguards could lead to human rights violations. The committee report noted that Clause 187(2) stipulates a total of 15 days for police custody, to be utilised in whole or in parts at any time during the initial 40 days or 60 days out of the detention period of 60 days or 90 days, as applicable. “However, there is a concern that this clause could be vulnerable to misuse by authorities, as it does not explicitly clarify that the custody was not taken in the first 15 days either due to the conduct of the accused or due to extraneous circumstances beyond the control of the investigating officer. The committee recommends that a suitable amendment may be brought to provide greater clarity in the interpretation of this clause,” it said. Government must provide reasons for commuting sentences The opposition MPs had also raised concerns about the power of the government to commute a sentence under Clause 475 of the new Bill. The committee in its report has, however, only recommended amending Clause 475(b) to specify both a minimum and maximum sentence that can be imposed on convicts while commuting imprisonment for life to a shorter term. It has also directed that the government must provide reasons for commuting a sentence. “To ensure that the power given to the appropriate government to commute a sentence is judiciously used and the commutation is justified, the committee recommends that appropriate reasons may be cited before commutation of a sentence,” it said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/law/supreme-court-union-govt-failure-clear-appointment-two-sikh-lawyers,Law,SC Pulls Up Union Govt Over Failure to Clear Appointment of Two Sikh Lawyers as HC Judges,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday, November 20, pulled up the Union government over the non-appointment of two Sikh lawyers as high court judges, once again noting that the “pick and choose” approach to the transfer and appointment of judges will create “embarrassing outcomes”. According to Bar and Bench, the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia referred to the government’s failure to clear the names of advocates Harmeet Singh Grewal and Deepinder Singh Nalwa for appointment as judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court. The duo was among five lawyers who were recommended for appointment by the Supreme Court Collegium on October 17. On November 2, the Union government notified the appointment of the three others but not Grewal and Nalwa. “Two of the candidates not cleared are both Sikhs. Why should this arise? Don’t let past issues link up with present pending ones,” Justice Kaul said, according to Bar and Bench. The court told attorney general R. Venakataramani that the “pick and choose” policy does not create a good impression. While the AG said the delay was due to elections and that progress has been made regarding the reiterated candidates, the top court observed that not even 50% of the names were cleared. According to The Hindu, the bench also warned that such a policy could lead to “embarrassing” outcomes such as deferring the swearing-in of new judges or withdrawing judges from judicial work. “What will happen at some stage is we cannot let judges whom we do not want to work in a court to continue to work in that court… Please do not let that happen. It will dilute the authority of judges. It will embarrass these judges,” Justice Kaul told the AG, according to the newspaper. Recently, the Gauhati high court deferred the swearing-in of lawyer Kaushik Goswami as a judge of the court. The government did not clear the name of N. Unni Krishnan Nair, who was also recommended for judgeship by the collegium, but as Goswami’s senior. The government only cleared Goswami’s appointment. After the high court deferred the swearing-in of Goswami, the government appointed Nair two days later. Justice Kaul noted once again on Monday that if a candidate does not know what seniority he or she would get, “it will be difficult to persuade other eligible and deserving candidates to join the bench,” according to The Hindu. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, for the petitioners, told the bench that the Supreme Court should issue a mandamus to the government to clear all the pending names within the next 24 hours. After the AG assured the court of action, the matter was listed for hearing on December 5. The top court was hearing a plea filed by the Advocates Association Bengaluru over delays in the appointment of judges. The collegium and the Narendra Modi government have been engaged in a tussle over the appointment and transfers of judges. The government has frequently refused to clear names recommended by the collegium. Experts believe that this has undermined the collegium’s power and has allowed the government to indirectly influence judicial appointments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/media/indian-journalist-k-k-shahina-among-winners-of-cpjs-international-press-freedom-awards,Media,Indian Journalist K.K. Shahina Among Winners of CPJ's International Press Freedom Awards,"New Delhi: Indian journalist and senior editor of Outlook magazine Shahina K.K. is one of the journalists honoured in this year’s International Press Freedom Awards given by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Shahina, the CPJ points out, was one of the first Indian journalists to be charged under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for her work in Tehelka magazine. The CPJ note continues: “She has continued her reporting in various posts despite awaiting trial for a case opened in 2010, when local government officials in Karnataka state sought to criminalize her reporting published in Tehelka, a prominent investigative magazine where she worked at the time. Her report cast doubt on a police investigation into 2008 bomb blasts in Bengaluru, alleging that the police had fabricated witness statements to arrest a local Muslim cleric. She faces three charges under the penal code, including criminal intimidation, intent to commit a criminal act, and criminal conspiracy, and one count under UAPA pertaining to threatening witnesses. As of June 2023, Shahina is out on bail pending trial. If convicted, she faces a maximum of three years in prison and a fine. A Muslim by birth, Shahina has also been subjected to extensive harassment by Indian right-wing groups seeking to silence her reporting on religious minorities and vulnerable caste groups. She has faced persistent online harassment and lewd threats, and in 2020, several right-wing publications falsely implicated her in that Bengaluru bombing. Based in Kochi, in the southern state of Kerala, Shahina has worked as a reporter, production associate, and news anchor with well-known news outlets including Asianet News, Janayugom, Open, and The Federal. She also has contributed to The Washington Post.” The CPJ has said in its note announcing Shahina’s win that this also highlights “India’s increasingly repressive environment for press freedom, with the targeting of journalists under draconian security laws, and toxic online campaigns particularly aimed at vilifying women journalists and ethnic or religious minorities.” Other awardees for this year include Nika Gvaramia from Georgia (founder and director of independent broadcaster, Mtavari Arkhi), María Teresa Montaño from Mexico (investigative reporter and founder and editor of The Observer, a fact-checking and investigative website) and Ferdinand Ayité from Togo (head of L’Alternative, one of Togo’s top investigative outlets). This year’s Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award from CPJ, which goes to “an individual who has shown extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom”, has been awarded to Alberto Ibargüen, who recently announced he is stepping down as president of the Knight Foundation after 18 years at its helm. “Under his leadership, the foundation invested over $2.3 billion in journalism, arts, economic development, and research. Ibargüen is the former publisher of the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald. During his tenure, the Miami Herald won three Pulitzer Prizes and El Nuevo Herald won Spain’s Ortega y Gasset Prize for excellence in journalism. He served on the board of CPJ from 1993 to 2005,” CPJ has said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/media/as-lachlan-murdoch-takes-over-he-may-need-to-reset-news-corps-relations-with-donald-trump,Media,"As Lachlan Murdoch Takes Over, He May Need to Reset News Corp’s Relations With Donald Trump","As Rupert Murdoch hands over the reins of News Corp and Fox to his son Lachlan, there is an opportunity to rebuild the relationship between the family’s media empire and former US president Donald Trump. This would make business sense for Fox as Trump is a ratings winner. But it may prove to be more difficult than it first appears. The deterioration of the relationship between the Murdochs and the former president resulted in Trump choosing not to attend the Fox’s Republican debates. But Trump’s refusal to participate in any of the three debates has not affected his chances of gaining the nomination. After the third debate on November 8, absent Trump was judged by 30% of the viewers to be the winner, in a J.L. Partners poll. Further proof, according to one commentator, that missing the debates has illustrated that Fox is more reliant on Trump than vice versa. Trump’s love-hate relationship with Fox has been a long one, particularly his connection with Murdoch and his family. During the late 1970s and 1980s, Trump featured regularly in the Page Six gossip column of the Murdoch-owned New York Post. His constant appearances in the paper catapulted Trump from a New York real-estate developer into a celebrity figure. During the 2016 election cycle, Murdoch originally supported Jeb Bush, the son of former president George H.W. Bush and brother to president George W. Bush. Trump’s initial support within the Fox organisation in 2016 was through Roger Ailes, the chief executive, as well as leading presenter Bill O’Reilly. When Trump became the leading candidate for the 2016 Republican nomination, the Post endorsed him for the candidacy, while Murdoch stated that the Republican Party would “be mad not to unify” behind him. Consequently, Fox and Trump’s relationship became a mutually supportive one – Fox supported his campaign, while Trump enhanced Fox’s viewing figures. That’s not to say it was all smooth sailing. In January 2016, he demanded that Fox anchor Megyn Kelly be replaced as host of the second Fox-hosted debate after he accused her of treating her badly in the first. When Fox refused, he avoided the second debate and told reporters: “Let’s see how much money Fox is going to make on the debate without me.” Fox News was committed to the Trump presidency. During the first year, Fox News acted as a crucial mouthpiece for the Trump administration. Fox and Friends, the station’s breakfast show was a conduit between Trump and Republicans, exaggerating Trump’s achievements. Trump reciprocated by parroting Fox’s talking points in his Twitter feed. The Trump-Fox relationship started to deteriorate on 2020 election night, when the station announced that Joe Biden had won the state of Arizona. For the Trump campaign, this was a betrayal. In March, Steve Bannon, host of the War Room podcast and Trump’s former chief strategist, told the audience at CPAC, the leading conservative conference, that Fox had done so illegitimately, constantly attacking Fox during his speech. The gulf between Trump and Fox widened in April of this year. Fox’s support of Trump’s baseless conspiracy theories surrounding vote rigging during the 2020 presidential election resulted in the organisation settling a defamation lawsuit with the owners of the voting machines, Dominion Voting Systems, for US$787.5 million (£631.8 million). According to some reports, the settlement of the case, which involved admitting that the claims were without merit, was seen by Trump as the organisation turning its back on him. This was made worse by Murdoch’s sworn testimony that “the election was not stolen”. Maga-hating Murdoch Trump still has a good rapport with some Fox hosts, but his relationship with Murdoch has deteriorated to the point where Trump called Murdoch and the Fox executives a group of “MAGA Hating Globalist RINOS” (Republican in name only). And his relationship with Fox in general is not the same as it was 2016. He also recently complained about being unfairly treated by Fox and Friends. Posting on his Truth Social website, Trump claimed his decision to not attend the debate was because he was so far in front of his rivals in recent polls. While viewing figures for the debate without Trump were higher than expected, they were half of those for the corresponding event in 2016. Trump’s decision to release a recorded interview on X with former Fox star Tucker Carlson shortly after the debate was another slap in the face for Fox. Choosing Carlson to be the host, who has stated he hated Trump on numerous occasions and claimed he himself had been fired from Fox News as part of the agreement with Dominion, was a thinly veiled attack on the channel. Trump’s absence from the debates is unlikely to affect his chances of getting the Republican nomination. Polling experts FiveThirtyEight give Trump 51.4% of the projected vote, with his nearest rival Floridian governor Ron DeSantis at a dwindling 14.5%. Lachlan Murdoch enters the fray Lachlan Murdoch thinks as much of Trump as his father does. One unnamed source is quoted as saying that Lachlan has “had trouble with Trump’s antics” in the past. So resetting the Murdoch-Trump relationship might not be so easy. It would show immense weakness on Lachlan’s part and might jeopardise his relationship with his father, according to Michael Wolff, Murdoch’s biographer. But regardless of who is in charge, Fox News will need to start rebuilding bridges with Trump to ensure that it maintains the attention of its Republican audience. After all, despite not being there, Trump was still the source of much debate and interaction between the candidates in the debates. Criticism of the format of the first Fox debate suggests that Fox needs to do something if it wants to win the ratings war. And with declining viewing figures for the debates without Trump, it needs to do something quickly. Meanwhile Trump, it seems, can do without Fox.

He was nominated by The Guardian, where Khan contributes as a regular freelancer. “Ahmer Khan’s journalism sheds light on some of the toughest and most heated issues in India, while his writing shows impact and sensitivity. He tackled one of the most difficult stories in one of the most difficult places. It’s fearless reporting at its best,” the jury has said. “Ahmer has been our go-to freelancer for all stories in India, not just because of previous projects (although our collaborations with him get better and better), but he’s reliable, he goes above and beyond for stories that he is passionate about. Many of the strongest videos we work on in the region come about, in part, from him pitching them to us,” The Guardian had said in its nomination. When the winners were announced on November 17, Khan said he was dedicating his prize to the “brave journalists working in Gaza who, in the line of duty, sacrificed their lives for journalism”. Super stoked to have been awarded ‘Martin Adler Prize’ for 2023 at BAFTA by @rorypecktrust last night in London. I would like to dedicate this win to the brave journalists working in #Gaza who, in the line of duty, sacrificed their lives for journalism. @guardian pic.twitter.com/TdQDYSDxUX — Ahmer Khan (@ahmermkhan) November 17, 2023  The Martin Adler Prize was inaugurated after Swedish freelance camera operator Martin Adler’s death in 2006 “to honour a local freelancer or field producer who has made a significant contribution to newsgathering”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/books/hari-krishna-kaul-stories,Books,The Weather in Kashmir,"Nath Ji and his wife Pyari pass their days with the help of props – reading the newspaper, watching TV, preparing meals, washing dishes. In a new house built late in life, they struggle to hold at bay a staggering loneliness. It is a loneliness that appears in different shapes in this new translation of Hari Krishna Kaul’s stories, For Now It Is Night. In the story of Nath Ji and Priya, ‘The Lights on the Other Side’, as in ‘A Moment of Madness’, (both from a collection originally published in Kashmiri in 2001), loneliness spirals around a son who has gone abroad to make his fortune. Yet the reader knows that something else also weighs down the couple, something that cannot make a tangible appearance in the story but that attaches itself like a dense weight to everything they say or do. If they feel abandoned, it is not only by their son, but also by their neighbours, their friends, by their city, and perhaps, most painfully, by history and life. The reader senses their isolation – and worse than isolation, their shame – which teaches them to conceal, from each other and even from themselves, their ardent yet unspeakable desire for a place where they would not feel irreparably misplaced. The intensity of this desire, however, is revealed only at the end of the story. Pyari, who had earlier given up eating mutton after hearing that the meat of ageing cows is often sold as mutton – who had felt revulsion and disgust at the very image of cow slaughter – takes a different position at the end of the story: “Having one’s throat slit is better,” she observes, “than being abandoned”. If earlier she had found her moorings in relating to the cow as a sacred and symbolic creature – and through the cow, in relating to the Hindu community – now she spontaneously identifies with the cow as an abandoned creature, one from whom care and fellowship has been withdrawn. Yes, death seems kinder than such abandonment. Hari Krishna Kaul, translated from Kashmiri by Kalpana Raina, Tanveer Ajsi, Gowhar Fazili and Gowhar YaqoobFor Now It Is NightHarper Perennial, 2023 The sense of having been forsaken merges quietly with the shame of encountering one’s essential superfluity. These short stories by the towering Kashmiri writer, Hari Krishna Kaul (1934-2009), translated from Kashmiri by Kalpana Raina, Tanveer Ajsi, Gowhar Fazili and Gowhar Yaqoob, bring into view a figure of the Batta, the Kashmiri Pandit, that one never encounters in popular Indian discourse about Kashmir. Compulsively replaying shrill enmities and self-righteous pieties, apparently impervious to shame, this discourse has systematically eliminated all the layered complexity that Kaul’s stories bring to our attention. Old or young, Kaul’s Batta often finds himself playing a dubious role in both his private and his public life. Regardless of whether the story centres around hostility between father and son (as in ‘Curfew’ or ‘A Late Winter’), or around a young man desperately seeking recognition and success (as in ‘Twins’ and ‘Dogs’), or indeed, any other theme, the reader is always conscious that there is something else impinging on the situation, bloating and contorting it. Kaul’s skill lies in never attempting to define this “something else.” Like his protagonists, who are aware that the most important things cannot be spoken, he stages this weight as a natural phenomenon: the weather in Kashmir. The cold, the snow, the wind, the rain, the sun, the heat…those immutable forces to which the fragile human body must always adapt lest it perish – these become emblematic of something peculiar to Kashmir. Kaul writes as if what oppresses Kashmiris is no longer something historical, human and contingent, but something irrevocable and unyielding. Yet even as he writes in this way, he knows the duplicity of doing so. Yes, let us blame the weather, he says ironically. Let us consider, for example, ‘A Song of Despair’ from the collection Haalas Chhu Rotul (1985). The story mocks a generation that prided itself on breaking traditional conventions, that questioned the authority of the father and everything that such authority represents, but that, over time, moulded itself in exactly the same image of the father it had earlier resisted. The narrator, presumably a young man, recounts how, perched on his windowsill on a hot summer night, he watched a series of scenes unfold in a house across the street. As he recounts what he saw, he intersperses his observations with recollections of the past. By the time we reach the conclusion, we know that this is not just a story about Sri Kak Tikoo, Kishan Chand and Roop Ji; that it has assumed allegorical proportions for the narrator himself during the very act of narration; and that what oppresses him is the relentless hold of caste and religious prejudice, the inevitable return of the unyielding father, and above all, his impotent rage against a political class that cynically repeats precisely what it had once defied. Defiance and transgression appear to him in retrospect as nothing but self-serving claims to power. Yet none of this can be explicitly articulated or acknowledged. Instead, this is all the narrator says: “I felt as if I would scream. [. . .]The night had begun to fade, but my restlessness had not. Usually, if I couldn’t sleep through the night, I would at least close my eyes at dawn. But tonight sleep was certainly upset with me, hiding far away. The heat, and humidity too, hadn’t ebbed. Summers are like this: the days burn you and the nights boil you; the evenings suffocate you and the mornings bring no relief.” The cyclical return of the unendurable is thus transposed on to the weather – the extreme, relentless, exceptional weather of Kashmir. If one detects irony here – the author’s gentle mockery of the narrator’s self-deception or self-protection – this irony nevertheless remains enmeshed in despair. We are aware that the story sings not just Khan Sahib’s or the narrator’s, but also Kaul’s, song of despair. Also read: There Is No Real Dislike for Cats in India – Art History Says as Much Quotidian encounters, insults and conversations assume an epic proportion in another story from the same 1985 collection, a story titled ‘That Which We Cannot Speak Of’. The Kashmiri Pandit who doesn’t deceive himself understands very well that what appears as unprovoked aggression on the part of working class Muslims is at least partly produced by an enduring pact among educated, middle-class Muslims and Hindus. The obscenity of this pact, which silently reserves and distributes resources within its limited circle, cannot escape those kept outside the circle. (Indeed, one should pay attention to the entire system of front rows and back rows, front doors and back doors, those let in and those kept out, that structures many of these stories). The narrator of this story is aware of this, and yet he is unable to plumb the depths of his own aversion to the barber Magga, who, by the sheer force of his aggression, pushes the narrator to confront his own corruption, as well as that of his community. As the story progresses, we descend deeper and deeper into a thicket of compromises and spite – a web of negotiation interwoven with a web of mutual suspicion. Thus the very act of storytelling is presented here as one that inevitably betrays secrets that the narrator would rather have withheld – in the act of telling, “blunders” are made and what should be hidden is clumsily brought to light. But what is brought to light is never an explanation or a meaningful revelation, only more and more stories – a sequence of related, interconnected shapes each of which withhold their final meaning. Hari Krishna Kaul. In his often-cited 1936 essay on the storyteller, the German philosopher Walter Benjamin presented us with a paradox. He wrote that storytelling has declined because our ability to communicate our experience, which is of the essence in storytelling, has waned. Yet it is not easy to understand what Benjamin means by such communication, since the stories to which he refers as models are those that do not in fact communicate a meaning or a moral to the reader. What they communicate, instead, is a plot without any attempt at psychologisation, so that the listener is provoked to ruminate, to puzzle over what has happened. The function of stories, Benjamin seems to say, is to bring us closer to the enigmas of human history – enigmas of which death remains both the limit and the custodian. If Hari Krishna Kaul’s stories often withhold explanation, this does not only render the stories more memorable, more capable of being deeply absorbed by the listener or the reader, as Benjamin suggests in his essay. It also lets the reader be absorbed precisely by their stifling insularity. That is perhaps why these stories make no attempt to breach this insularity by explicitly connecting the Kashmir they describe with a wider geopolitical domain. By the time we read the last stories of the collection, from a collection published in 2001, it becomes apparent that the claustrophobic insularity that some of the other stories obliquely critique has itself become, for those exiled from it, a lost and desired object. This may be why such insularity must be kept intact, at least for Kaul’s generation of Pandits. Although translations of fiction are almost always a labour of love, in reading translations one rarely feels that the translation itself is a gift to the original. By this I mean, not that the translation extends the life of the original, or brings to it a new readership – that, of course, most translations do. I mean, rather, that the translation itself somehow intervenes in, rearranges, addresses, the very anxieties that traverse the original. Without offering any facile hope or resolution to the loss or despair of which these stories speak – indeed, precisely by staying close to this despair (For Now, It Is Night) – the translation is nevertheless able to enact and hence generate a kind of community that only appears as an absence in these stories – namely, a community of Kashmiris, both Muslim and Hindu, who, even if they might have left Kashmir, have abandoned neither Kashmir nor those who, like Kaul, kept attentive vigil over its vicissitudes. Also read: ‘The Absent Color’: Mapping the Contours of ‘A Nil’ World, a Trial for Imagination There is much more that could be said about these stories – for example, about the wry humour that leavens them, the spirit of Kafka that sometimes seems to flash across a story, the impress of the great Akhtar Mohiuddin on Kaul’s writing, and the rigorous economy of the translation. There are many questions I puzzled over as I read: was Premchand’s ‘Kafan’ on Kaul’s mind when he wrote ‘The Mourners’? Are these stories taught in Kashmir today, and if so, how are they taught? What do contemporary Kashmiri readers make of the thinly veiled allusions to homosexuality? Had Kaul read Ismat Chughtai? What were some of the most difficult phrases and words to translate into English? Other readers will doubtless ponder over their own questions as they read these stories. I only hope that there will be many such readers, for the labour of love that has produced this beautiful translation will find fertile ground only if we read, reflect upon, and in turn translate these stories into our own thought-worlds.

https://thewire.in/world/anand-patwardhan-idfa-immediate-ceasefire,World,"In IDFA Award Acceptance Speech, Anand Patwardhan Calls For ‘Immediate Ceasefire’ and ‘Just Peace’","New Delhi: Indian documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan has called for an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in his acceptance speech for the Best Editing award at the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). Patwardhan won the award for his film titled Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam/The World is Family. The festival, the world’s largest documentary gathering, has long been seen as being politically vocal and has come under criticism in its latest edition for attempting to tread carefully in the ongoing conflict.  It has faced criticism first from some Israeli and American filmmakers, and then from Palestinian filmmakers. According to a report in Deadline, the opening night ceremony of the festival last Wednesday saw three pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupting IDFA artistic director Orwa Nyrabia’s remarks.  They were carrying a banner bearing the controversial slogan, “From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free”, which is viewed by many Jews as anti-Semitic and calling for the destruction of Israel. While Nyrabia applauded the protesters on stage, he later issued a joint apology after facing criticism from members of Israel’s film community as well as some documentary filmmakers in the US.  His apology then drew criticism from many Palestinian filmmakers including Basma al-Sharif, a Palestinian director and artist who withdrew a film at the festival.  Palestinian filmmaker Jumana Manna also took to Instagram to announce the cancellation of her film at the festival. In his acceptance speech, Patwardhan said that he took the opportunity to “amplify all international voices calling for an immediate ceasefire in Palestine, Ukraine and other ongoing war zones.” He said that “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is a “misunderstood slogan” and its real meaning – which he said was “a call for a land where Muslims, Jews, Christians and all others can live together in peace and harmony and with equal rights” – should be emphasised. Patwardhan also lauded those who pulled out of the festival, those who stayed back to continue to debate and those who “allowed the space” to do so. “Our protests have been non-violent. Non-violence can build a global community. In many parts of the world Palestinians and Jews are marching together with others to demand an immediate ceasefire and a just peace,” he said. His acceptance speech is reproduced below: § Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam/The World is Family Acceptance speech for Best Editing Award at IDFA, 2023 I take this opportunity to amplify all international voices calling for an immediate ceasefire in Palestine, Ukraine and other ongoing war zones.  “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” is a misunderstood slogan. Some interpret it as a slogan calling for a One State solution and the ethnic cleansing of Jews. This misunderstanding is why the real meaning of the slogan should be explained and emphasized – it is a call for a land where Muslims, Jews, Christians and all others can live together in peace and harmony and with equal rights. I applaud those who pulled out of the festival and sparked an international debate. I applaud those who stayed back to continue the debate from within. And I applaud those who allowed us the space to do it. Our protests have been non-violent. Non-violence can build a global community. In many parts of the world Palestinians and Jews are marching together with others to demand an immediate ceasefire and a just peace.  The entire world is enslaved by a global arms industry that profits from every war and from every death. It is from this slavery that our world must be set free. The world is family. Anand Patwardhan 16 November 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/political-economy/book-review-is-indias-economy-really-that-bad,Political Economy,India's Economy: Is It Really That Bad?,"For the first 44 years after independence, India’s development and prospects aroused little enthusiasm, whether among Indians or western commentators. Things started changing after the reforms of the Narasimha Rao led government in 1991. That much-celebrated economic liberalisation aligned well with the zeitgeist in the Western world: a shrinking role for government and a celebration of the private sector, accompanied by relentless homilies about globalisation. Narratives of profound economic change erupted, and haven’t stopped since. For more than three decades now, we have heard and read about the emerging phenomenon that is India. It has been hailed as a potential superpower, a sleeping giant, a great untapped market and a country finally reclaiming its supposedly deserved spot on the global stage. This image clashes with reports of continuing poverty and deprivation, dangerously high pollution, urban decay, crumbling infrastructure, an overwhelmed judicial system and horrific atrocities in the name of religion and caste. This presents a case of cognitive dissonance that is difficult to reconcile, not just for outsiders, but for Indians as well. Is India doing well, or poorly? There are two ways to examine India’s economic performance since independence. One is to compare it with its own past, under British misrule. The other is to compare it to what other countries managed to achieve within the same or similar periods. Even though national income statistics for India began to be compiled only after independence, estimates of growth in the first half of the 20th century, according to the Maddison Project Database, show that GDP grew only by 0.9% per year. Population growth of 0.8% per year meant that per capita GDP grew at the anaemic rate of 0.1%. Growth rates picked up right after independence, and notwithstanding all the flaws of successive governments, the stark contrasts provide a clear indictment of British imperialism in India. Also Read: Averting a $10-Trillion Dystopia That there has been significant economic growth after independence is not in doubt. First, during the 1950s and 1960s, India’s economy grew at over 3% annually. There was a clear deceleration in the 1970s, which was reversed by much higher growth rates over the next three decades. A commonly held, but demonstrably false view is that India’s high growth phase began only after the reforms of the early 1990s. The data show that the phase actually began a decade earlier, with the growth rate over the 1980s being almost identical to that in the 1990s. Despite the much-improved economic growth relative to the first half of the twentieth century, the growth rates in the first three decades after independence led to much disappointment, dashed expectations, and the coinage of the term “Hindu rate of growth”. The disappointment arose from an obvious comparison with the contemporary economic performance of other countries: India’s rate of growth from 1950 to 1980 was slower than the world average, as well as the average for developing countries. One line of reasoning is to claim that India is sui generis – there is no other country quite like ours, so comparisons are not meaningful. This, of course, is an evasive manoeuvre. There is much that India can learn from the experience of other countries. Still, comparisons with Western nations are a stretch, due to their history of imperialism and the fact that the industrial revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had their provenance in Europe. A much better peer group consists of Asian countries, several of which were victims of imperialism, and were starting with very similar initial conditions circa 1950. The numbers below show that several of these countries did better than India in terms of growth. Vietnam was the exception, but it was plagued by the French and American wars until 1975. Calculations based on data from the Maddison Project Database. While there are important questions that arise from comparing GDP growth across countries, the GDP level and its growth rate have turned into an unhealthy obsession in recent years. Everyone knows that India has the fastest GDP growth, is the third or the fifth largest economy, and that the level will reach X trillion some years from now, where X is five, or twenty, or thirty, or whatever number the speaker feels like throwing out there. The most popular level is, of course, five trillion, though some ruling party members have had trouble specifying the number of zeros in a trillion, or have confused a five trillion dollar economy with a five million ton economy, or have counselled us to not to get into the maths since it allegedly never helped Einstein. Beyond the laughable innumeracy lies a blinkered collective view of development which derives a bizarre kind of pride from the size of the economy. So, it is worth pointing out that elementary algebra tells you that there is nothing remarkable about India’s GDP level reaching five trillion dollars in a few years from now. According to the government’s 2023 budget documents, India’s GDP was estimated to be Rs 273.1 trillion, or $3.3 trillion at the current exchange rate of Rs 83 per dollar. To get to $5 trillion, the dollar value of the GDP needs to grow by 52%, or by 8.7% per year in nominal terms if we choose a horizon of 5 years. Assuming a rupee depreciation of about 4% per year means that India’s nominal GDP in rupees has to grow by about 12.7% per year. For expected real GDP growth in the near future, we can use the average since 1980, which is about 5.6% per year. A reasonable value for expected inflation is 5% per year, which gets us to about 10.6%. This is short of the 12.7% required, but a slight tweaking of expected real growth rates, or inflation, or rupee depreciation, will make the calculation work. If the tweaks seem unrealistic, we can always move the goalposts and say we will get there in six or seven years. Also Read: The Many Economic Guarantees and Promises of the Modi Government The point is that getting to a five-trillion-dollar economy in five to seven years requires no major policy innovations, grand vision or administrative brilliance. If the economy performs as it has for the last few decades on average, we will get there simply by the magic of compounding. Setting aside the calculation, the notion of a high GDP level as a dominant concern is troubling. As the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explains lucidly, the measure is very limited in its scope and applicability to understanding public welfare. As a measure of development, its drawbacks are well-known: it says nothing about the distribution of income, it ignores non-market transactions in goods and services, and it does not account for the steep cost of environmental destruction. Apart from these problems with the concept itself, there are significant measurement difficulties and statistical issues connected to how the numbers are produced. No wonder that economists cast doubt on the reported numbers for India as well as for China. The narrow focus on a single indicator such as the GDP was a late-20th century phenomenon, amplified by multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the IMF. Contrary to this, even elementary economics textbooks tell you that there are at least three main macroeconomic variables: output, employment and inflation. Development economists have suggested measures of welfare combining multiple indicators, while also advocating for a dashboard of economic measures, rather than a single number. Even if we think that the metrics suggested by development economists are difficult to measure, India would do well to shift its focus to the other two main macroeconomic variables according to textbooks: employment and inflation. It is clear that opposition parties intend to highlight these two issues in the 2024 elections. Remarkably, these were exactly the same issues that caused much political turmoil fifty years ago, in 1974, in the eventual leadup to the Emergency. That’s clear evidence for civilisational continuity in India’s political economy.  Ashoka ModyIndia is BrokenStanford University Press (February 2023) Ashoka Mody’s book, India is Broken, is a great antidote to blinkered growth-focused thinking. The superbly crafted book highlights that any fair evaluation of the economy has to answer the question of how growth has benefitted India’s people at large. It is simultaneously a political history and a sustained critique of India’s economic trajectory. Its scathing judgements are telegraphed in its table of contents: we have “Part 1: Fake Socialism, 1947-1964”, “Chapter 10, India Has an Empress”, “Chapter 16, Rajiv Unleashes the Gale Force of Hindu Nationalism”, and “Chapter 21, Modi Pushes the Economy off the Edge”, among others. This searing indictment of India’s political economy over the last 75 years is a refreshing change from the relentless boosterism of the last couple of decades or the anodyne assessments of many commentators. The popular narrative of India’s post-independence economic history has congealed around a combination of stylised facts and mindless repetition of uninformed myths: Nehru was a socialist and was responsible for the low rates of growth; the licence-permit raj under Indira and Rajiv Gandhi strangulated the economy until the reforms of Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh liberated it; there is something called the Gujarat model; “nothing was done” in 70 years, etc. Mody does an excellent job of demolishing these nuggets of received wisdom. He is particularly clear-eyed about Nehru, offering a bracing contrast to the hagiography of many writers. As he points out, Nehru’s socialism was mostly rhetorical, bearing little resemblance either to Soviet socialism or to European social democratic practice. Indeed, even the label Fabian socialism is misapplied to Nehru, since the exemplar of that variety, Clement Attlee, pioneered free health care, secondary education and social insurance in the UK – all conspicuously absent in Nehru’s India. The primary economic thrust of the Nehru years was heavy industry, aligned with the idea of big push industrialisation, which was popular at the time. Mody thinks this was a serious mistake and that the focus should have been on labour-intensive light industry, which would have generated far more employment and let India take advantage of the post-World War trade boom. The unifying theme in the book’s critique of India’s economic policies is the lack of focus on job creation. This is a powerful and intuitive organising principle. It runs as a consistent thread through independent India’s economic history. Also Read: Three Claims of Government Economists About Jobs Put to the Test Generally, output growth and employment are positively correlated, but the magnitude of this correlation is unusually low for India. Low unemployment and good jobs clearly benefit individuals, but also have enormous social impact – it is a commonplace observation in many societies that unemployed youth provide fertile recruiting grounds for all manner of political violence, and India is no exception. Making job creation a priority – through budgetary allocations and policies favouring labour-intensive manufacturing with an export orientation – does not mean giving up on GDP growth, as shown by Japan, Korea, Taiwan and China. Mody references the work of A.K. Ghose to estimate that India’s jobs shortfall was already at a staggering 20-25 million in 1955. The situation only worsened in subsequent decades, with the backlog reaching 30-35 million in 1965, 40-45 million by the mid-1980s, 58 million in 2000 and at least 80 million by 2019. The much-touted demographic dividend, to be realised from a bulging youth population, has the flip side that it will require an additional seven to nine million jobs per year. These numbers demonstrate the futility of focussing on GDP growth alone – India’s best GDP growth phase, from 2003 to 2011, did little to make a dent in the mountain of the jobs backlog. Mody notes that the high growth period in India was driven by a finance and construction boom, which did not create enough new jobs. More generally, this phenomenon of ‘jobless growth’ has been noted widely, and is a result of much of the growth happening in the services sector. Due to missteps going back to the 1950s, India seems to have skipped the intermediate stage of a transition from a primarily agricultural economy to an industrial one, directly going to a service sector-dominated economy. In terms of development, the lack of jobs is compounded by the failure in developing human capital. This failure began in the Nehru era, and has continued ever since, as described in detail by Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze in their 2013 book India: An Uncertain Glory.  Education and health expenditures have lagged behind world averages for a very long time. It is not as if this wasn’t realised early on. Back in 1966, the Kothari commission recommended that 6% of national income be devoted to education. Sadly, this target is yet to be achieved. Mody makes the case that India has delayed the provision of public goods such as education, health care and infrastructure for far too long. There has been progress – for example, primary school enrolment is now near universal in India, but the quality of education remains very poor. The neglect of primary education results in low worker productivity, which erodes the advantage of low labour costs in Indian industry. Alongside the many economic insights, Mody also focuses on what he calls a Catch-22 situation – the erosion of norms and accountability, the restoration of which would require accountability. One only needs to think of regular reports from UP and Bihar, among other states, to see that erosion of norms and accountability is an uncharacteristically restrained phrase to describe the high corruption, white-collar thievery and the criminalisation of politics. Again, it is notable that the rot had started early. Mody notes that Nehru was already dismissing concerns about corruption in the late 1950s and that in August 1962, home minister Lal Bahadur Shastri said in parliament that the government had punished 20,000 officials for corruption over the previous five years. The Santhanam committee report in 1963 highlighted a culture of corruption in government – apparently the going commission rate for PWD contracts was between 7% and 11% at the time. That indicative metric has jumped four to sixfold, if the ‘40% sarkara’ allegations are anything to go by. Also Read: Ten Factors to Remember Amidst the Congress’s Win and BJP’s Defeat in Karnataka During the Indira Gandhi years, political corruption reached the very top, with Sanjay Gandhi, her heir apparent and poster boy for undeserved privileges, becoming the focal point for Congress party funds. Stories of briefcases of cash changing hands in exchange for business licenses and permits during this era abound. Busting yet another myth about bureaucratic control arising from socialism during the Nehru era, Mody traces the origins of the notorious ‘license-permit raj’, quoting from I.G. Patel’s memoirs. Import licensing was simply an ad hoc response to dwindling foreign exchange reserves in late 1956 and early 1957 due to the heavy import demands of the second five-year plan. It took on a life of its own and soon led to industrial licensing, and to many creative opportunities for lobbying and political contributions by businesses in pursuit of their interests. Today’s crony capitalism is just a newer version of this. Overall, the primary attraction of Mody’s book is that it is a narrative of India’s post-independence political economy and not simply an account of policy mis-steps and economic shocks. The book provides a well-informed and sceptical evaluation of the Indian economy, most importantly of the disconnect between decades of pious rhetoric and underwhelming eventual outcomes. After all is said and done, what is the answer to the simplistic question: is India doing well economically? Mody’s book says it is not, with its title reflecting the author’s downbeat assessment. But then, how does one square this with the lived experience of many Indians? They see the six-lane expressways, Vande Bharat trains, malls, shiny airports, gated multi-storied apartment buildings (with separate lifts for the help), UPI and a hundred-plus unicorns. They are only dimly aware of another India in which people are struggling to find jobs while battling the spiralling cost of living, poverty, deprivation and social injustice. The big difficulty is that these two portraits of India are simultaneously true – which is what leads to the clashing narratives and cognitive dissonance. There is some truth to what has long been a cliche: you can make a good case for every generalisation about India as well as its opposite. Does this mean that the two views are only different in their perception about the metaphorical glass being half full or half empty? Not quite. Economic growth has benefited middle and upper-class Indians the most. This is a significant fraction, but not a majority. About one-third of Indian households earn more than Rs 5 lakh per year, and can be classified as middle or upper class, according to one survey from November 2022.

https://thewire.in/rights/no-space-in-germany-for-open-exchange-of-ideas-after-hoskote-other-documenta-panel-members-quit,Rights,"‘No Space in Germany for Open Exchange of Ideas’: After Hoskote, Other Documenta Panel Members Resign","New Delhi: Days after Mumbai-based author and curator Ranjit Hoskote and Israeli painter Bracha Ettinger resigned from the Finding Committee for the upcoming 16th edition of Documenta in Kassel, Germany, the four remaining members have also stepped down. The four members, including Paris-based independent curator, lecturer, art critic Simon Njami; Gong Yan of the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art; Vienna-based art curator Kathrin Rhomberg; and São Paulo-based curator María Inés Rodríguez, resigned in an open letter addressed to Dr. Andreas Hoffmann, managing director, Documenta and Museum Fridericianum gGmbH on November 16. Documenta is the world’s most prestigious art exhibition, which takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany. In their letter, the four members said that their decision comes against the backdrop of the resignations of Hoskote and Ettinger. “The dynamics of the last few days, with their unchallenged media and public discrediting of our colleague Ranjit Hoskote, which forced him to resign from the Finding Committee, make us very doubtful if this prerequisite for any coming edition of Documenta is currently given in Germany. Art requires a critical and multi-perspective examination of its diverse forms and contents to be able to resonate and develop its transformative capacity. Categorical, one-sided reductions and over-simplifications of complex contexts threaten to nip any such examination in the bud,” they wrote in the letter. Hoskote’s resignation followed an article published in Germany’s daily Süddeutsche Zeitung on November 9, 2023. Saying that a 2019 letter signed by Hoskote, among others, was “clearly antisemitic”, Germany’s culture minister Claudia Roth threatened to withdraw public funding for the event. The 2019 letter was published as part of the article in Suddeutsche Zeitung on November 9. The letter, circulated by the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) global movement, aimed to exert pressure on Tel Aviv to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and adhere to human rights laws. Ettinger’s resignation on November 12 was unrelated to the controversy surrounding Hoskote. ARTnews reported that her decision was prompted by the “dark times” affecting her country, Israel. In their letter, the four members said that they understand that in view of its past, Germany has “distinct social and political responsibilities.” “The great sensitivity towards all anti-Semitic tendencies bears eloquent witness to the extent to which the nation has internalised this responsibility. The ongoing fulfilment of this very responsibility deserves the greatest appreciation, especially now, when alarming signs of deep-rooted anti-Semitism are once again making themselves felt around the world.” “At the same time, however, this awareness of special responsibilities runs the risk of being misused for opinion politics in order to suppress undesirable approaches and their broad and open discussion right from the start. Instead of debate and discussion, over-simplification and prejudgments are thus all too easily substituted,” they said. In the last edition as well, the exhibition was engulfed in a scandal around its alleged proximity to BDS and a dispute over anti-Semitic iconography. The four members said in the letter: “It is this emotional and intellectual climate of over-simplification of complex realities and its resulting restrictive limitations, which has been prevalent since documenta15 and especially against the background of the current crises our world is facing, that makes it impossible for us to conceive of a strong and signal exhibition project, and consequently to allow for a responsible continuation of the selection process to determine a curatorial concept for documenta16.” The Finding Committee, according to the organisers, “has the task of inviting pioneering figures in contemporary art to apply to take on the role of Artistic Direction of documenta 16, and to select the most promising format from the concepts presented. Appointment of the Artistic Direction is targeted for late 2023 / early 2024.” However, the four members said that against the backdrop of current developments, there is no space for “open exchange of ideas” in Germany. “In the current circumstances we do not believe that there is a space in Germany for an open exchange of ideas and the development of complex and nuanced artistic approaches that documenta artists and curators deserve. We do not believe that any acceptable conditions can be created in short term and consider it to be disrespectful of documenta’s legacy to simply remain content with the current situation,” the four members’ letter said.   Prior to Hoskote’s resignation on November 12, Ettinger had also stepped down  for reasons that she stated were not connected to the accusations levelled against Hoskote but because Israel was enduring “dark times.”  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/the-arts/art-historian-bn-goswamy-obituary,The Arts,The Majestic Aerial Course of B.N. Goswamy,"Legendary art historian B.N. Goswamy passed away on November 17, 2023. He was 90. Goswamy was the recipient of the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. The following was written by Laila Tyabji as a Facebook post and has been republished with minor edits and her permission. One by one, the candles that illuminated one’s mind space are being blown out – Ela Ben, Brij Bhasin, Jasleen Dhamija, and now Professor B.N. Goswamy… I heard Professor Goswamy before I actually met him – attending every talk he gave in Delhi; so enjoying the theatre of the man as well as his towering intellect. His wonderful rich deep voice, his command of and skilfully apposite use of Urdu, Farsi, Punjabi, and English verse, his imposing height and appearance. The impeccably tailored suits (sometimes relieved by a colourful silk scarf, or in winter by a pashmina shawl tossed casually over a shoulder); his ability to adroitly lead us through the minutiae of scholarship and research to an exciting revelation of a new insight or idea – making the journey as well as the arrival enthralling, his humour and his erudition both worn lightly. We first got to know each other as fellow members of the Crafts Museum Acquisitions Committee through the 1990s. Each meeting added so much to my understanding – not just of Indian art, but of worlds past and present. So I was deeply touched when in 2011 I reviewed his wonderful biography of Nain Sukh of Guler, the master 18th century miniature painter from the Kangra valley, for the IIC Journal, and he wrote to say how much he had liked what I had written. It is still one of my favourite books of a Sherlock Holmes-turned-art-historian. He had such beautiful manners, always making one feel the giver rather than recipient of any interchange. When we were both together on the Crafts Museum Committee, no one was better at breaking the news to a hopeful dealer that the object he was trying to sell was spurious. Also read: There Is No Real Dislike for Cats in India – Art History Says as Much “You value it, and that is as important as it actually being an antique. Take it back home and enjoy it,” I remember his saying to one disgruntled vendor! Unforgettable too, was him holding a thaan of early 19th century Dhakai muslin in his arms – translucent and incredibly fine, as light and buoyant as a cloud. His expression was that of someone cradling his first grandchild! He then recited Agha Shahid Ali’s evocative poem on ‘Dhaka Gauzes’. It was the first time I’d heard it. I recall the release in 2013 of a commemorative volume in honour of Professor Goswamy’s 80th birthday. Dr Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister, much beleaguered at the time, launched it at his residence with his usual dignity, warmth and unexpected humour. He and Professor Goswamy were classmates, and later colleagues, in college. And, of course, Professor Goswamy, then 80, was his usual charming, insightful, multi-lingually articulate, impeccably dressed self (he was one scholar not dressed in a Fabindia kurta!) The only negative was the security rigmarole of getting into the PM’s house, including a transfer from ones own car into an official one. I remember him too at one of our Dastkar Bazaars, making me take him to all my most loved handloom weavers, so he could buy sarees for his beautiful wife, Karuna, a fellow scholar and historian, who had once been his student. When both our arms overflowed with silken fabrics, Karuna began protesting. She was firmly put into a chair, given a plate of chaat and jalebis, and told not to interrupt our vital research! Karuna’s death, and that of his son Apu, greatly saddened his latter years. In his book on Nain Sukh, Professor Goswamy writes of Nain Sukh’s magical artistry – “From a stray work, he simply picks an idea, refines it, gives it wings, and sends it soaring on its majestic aerial course.” One could say the same of his own scholarship, writing and speaking. His thoughts will soar on, even though he himself is gone. Nevertheless, we will sorely miss him.

https://thewire.in/culture/watch-the-resonance-of-resilience-kashmirs-musical-odyssey,Culture,Watch | The Resonance of Resilience: Kashmir's Musical Odyssey ,"Explore the enchanting melodies of Ali Saifuddin, Numan, Furqan Baba, and Ehmad Parvez in this video set against the backdrop of the beautiful Kashmir Valley.  Numan and Furqan, self-taught musicians, craft their melodies using nothing but their laptops. Their digital exploration of music not only showcases the power of technology in the artistic process but also symbolises a contemporary approach to the age-old art form. Ali Saifuddin, on the other hand, is not just a musician but a harbinger of change in the Kashmiri music scene. Balancing a day job with his musical pursuits, he grapples with the reality that music alone cannot always sustain him. Beyond the notes, Ali is deeply connected to the political turmoil in Kashmir, using his music as a form of expression and a catalyst for change. Meanwhile, the narrative introduces us to Ehmad Parvez, a young artist navigating his musical journey from the bustling streets of Delhi. His experiences and perspectives add a dynamic layer to the overarching story, reflecting the diaspora of Kashmiri talent beyond the valley. Numan, Furqan, Ali, and Ehmad collectively contribute to a rich tapestry of musical narratives that traverse the diverse landscapes of Kashmir and beyond. This video serves as a testament to the resilience of artists who, despite their varied backgrounds and challenges, find a common language in music, echoing the vitality that defines the spirit of Kashmir.  As the video unfolds, it shows the remarkable ascent of singers like Yawar Abdal and several others, whose resonant melodies extend beyond the verdant valleys of Kashmir to captivate audiences in India, Pakistan, and even Western countries. These voices, once confined to the regional sphere, have become stars on the global stage, showcasing the universal appeal of Kashmiri music. Additionally, the documentary takes a significant dive into the burgeoning scene of female rappers in Kashmir, offering a nuanced glimpse into their artistic endeavours. The emergence of female voices in Kashmiri rap marks a progressive step forward, challenging stereotypes and contributing to a more inclusive musical landscape.

https://thewire.in/books/art-history-cats-bn-goswamy-indian-cat,Books,There Is No Real Dislike for Cats in India – Art History Says as Much,"This excerpt, first published on October 20, 2023, was republished on November 17, 2023, the day the author passed away. The following is an excerpt from B.N. Goswamy’s The Indian Cat: Stories, Paintings, Poetry, and Proverbs, published by Aleph Book Company this year. It is best to begin with a confession, I think. Strictly speaking, I am not a cat lover. I am therefore not even entitled perhaps to put together a book on cats. But, somehow, they have stayed in my awareness for long years. When a stray one sneaked into our house once, for instance, and Apu, my son, took to her, cold and shivering as she was when she came in. He fed her, held on to her, gave her a name – Katja it was if I remember aright – and, after returning from school, he would talk to her first, ahead of anyone else at home. It was a few years before we shifted home and she decided against moving. As simple as that. ‘The Indian Cat: Stories, Paintings, Poetry, and Proverbs,’ B.N. Goswamy, Aleph Book Company, 2023. Then, years later, I had a faintly bristly encounter with a whole pride of cats at the home of a dear friend in Zurich: Ursula Dohrn. She loved cats, had many of them, and they had all become members of her family. Whenever I went to visit her, they were there, naturally and everywhere: if one was occupying the first seat on a sofa, another was lurking under the centre table, and yet another clambering onto her shoulder sometimes. For me it was not easy and, almost complainingly, I once told Ursula during a visit how hard it was to find a quiet moment with her without the cats participating in the conversation, nodding approval, or saying something in a whispered purr to her. Quickly, in a tone of mock-admonishment, Ursula shot back. ‘You are an art historian, Brijinder, are you not?’ ‘I am; or so I think,’ I replied. ‘Then, you should love cats: all art historians do.’ This unsettled me a bit, but she went on. ‘Annemarie Schimmel does: she has in fact even written more than one book on them.’ I knew and held Professor Schimmel in great regard, but this fact I was not aware of.   ‘ST. JEROME’, Mughal; ca. 1600–20, Brendan Lynch/Oliver Forge auction catalogue, 2014[Now in the collection of Franz-Josef and Birgit Vollmer, Gundelfingen] with another name, another highly regarded art historian – Stella Kramrisch. ‘She is a cat lover, is she not?’ So she was, I knew, for I had seen a whole lot of them around her whenever I visited her, first in her Paoli home, and later in her apartment in the heart of Philadelphia. These firm statements showed me my place as far as Ursula’s cats went. It wasn’t over yet, however. For, the next day, a book was delivered to my apartment: a paperback edition of Annemarie Schimmel’s work – much celebrated I was to learn – in German: Die Orientalische Katze, with the subtitle: Mysticism and Poetry of the Orient. Sent obviously by Ursula, but without a note. She was driving a point home. I felt informed, but, as an art historian, not particularly persuaded. Or obligated. It was a bit later that I became involved: not so much with cats as with the idea of cats.  ‘CAT IN THE AYODHYA PALACE,’ Folio from the Freer Ramayana Mughal, ca. 1600, [Freer–Sackler Gallery, Washington, DC; 1907.272.102, vol. I, folio 102] The former refers to how the young one of a monkey – markata in Sanskrit – approaches God, and the latter to how the young one of a cat – marjara – does. Briefly put, ‘markata-nyaya refers to the behaviour of a baby monkey, who clings tightly to its mother wherever she goes. The mother monkey’s arms are occupied as she leaps from tree to tree; she does not hold on to the baby; but as long as the baby holds firmly to her, it arrives safely’.  Whereas ‘marjara-nyaya refers to the behaviour of kittens, who are likely to wander. The mother cat picks them up by the scruff of the neck and carries them wherever she wants them to be. The kitten is passive; she makes no effort but arrives safely by surrendering to the mother’s protective grasp.’ It is up to the devotee, then, to choose: to keep making an effort to cling for succour to his deity, or to leave everything to the deity, trusting him and surrendering to him completely. No recommendation is made, no preference indicated.  PRINCESS WATCHING A MAID KILLING A SNAKE, By Mir Kalan Khan, Lucknow; c. 1770, [Collection: British Library; Johnson Album 15, no. 8] It is an accusation that one person might fling at his rival while calling him a ‘cheat’, or a ‘hypocrite’. In an episode in that ancient epic of ours, the Mahabharata, Duryodhana charges even the noble Yudhishthira with observing the marjara-vrata, not once, but repeatedly.  Clearly, the cat had come to stand for ‘hypocrisy’ – ‘ye gods, that person whose standard of righteousness is always up, but whose sins are always concealed’ – and the opprobrium seems to have endured over a very long time: cleverness, hypocrisy, avarice, inscrutability, thievery. Interestingly enough, however, in our land at the same time there is no real dislike for cats. There are superstitions around her figure, for certain, and stories go on being repeated.  But no fatwas have been passed; no papal bulls issued. Great poets like Mir and Ghalib loved their cats to distraction; the poet Jibanananda Das saw himself in a cat that went here and there, following the Sun; Vikram Seth saw her as full of mischief and cleverness but no evil. In fact, on a daily basis, the feline is ‘addressed’ almost with affection. She is ‘maano’, ‘maaoon’, ‘mausi’ (mother’s sister), ‘pisshi’, ‘biloongari’, if one goes by usage, at least in the northern parts of our land. It is somewhere out of these memories and stray thoughts and scattered observations – whether it was mock-admonishment that I received as an art historian, seductive and long-buried snippets that reading about cats yielded, or the fact that my son adopted recently two cats – that the present work has emerged. Of course, the reader is entitled to ask: ‘So?’ But he will at least find inside absorbing tales and images and poetry and proverbs, that I gathered together. All on cats. Indian cats. A word of explanation to end with, however. Inadvertently, because one is so used to it in one’s own life, the cat in my account is always taken to be a female. Lacking in logic as this is, the gender is open to change. Second word: the book is confined, strictly confined, to cats in India – domestic cats – not because they are unique, but because cats elsewhere – and they are everywhere – have their own histories, their own tales, their own place in life.

https://thewire.in/economy/real-growth-figures-4-trillion-gdp-hoax-story,Economy,A Look at the Real Growth Figures Amid the $4 Trillion GDP Hoax Story,"New Delhi: Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with the news that India’s GDP crossed the $4 trillion mark – although there wasn’t any official confirmation of this achievement. A screenshot claiming India’s GDP crossed $4 trillion was taken from a YouTube channel, according to news reports. The channel, LiveStream07, claimed that it collated real-time GDP data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 The IMF, however, told BOOM that this is incorrect because they do not collate real-time GDP data. Economists have also said that the Union government’s National Statistical Office is the only official source of data. The numbers for the July-September 2023 quarter will be released on November 30. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis tweeted saying: “This is what visionary, dynamic leadership looks like! That’s what our New India progressing beautifully looks like! Congratulations to our fellow Indians as our Nation crosses the $4 trillion GDP milestone!

Another two years to go before India becomes the 3rd largest nation in terms of Global GDP by overtaking Japan at $4.4 trillion and Germany at $4.3 trillion. The Tricolour surge continues! Jai Hind.” Claims and promises are commonplace in the rhetoric of governments, particularly in the run-up to elections. For example, the assertion that India will become a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is a focal point in the media, with leaders of the ruling BJP proudly championing it as evidence of the growth and development promised by the Narendra Modi-led administration. Also read: Understanding GDP Growth Through Discrepancies and Why the Major Push Is Not Visible But why boast about a growing GDP? Highlighting a growing GDP is a way to showcase economic success during the current government’s tenure. It suggests that policies and governance have contributed to a robust and expanding economy. A growing economy is often associated with job creation. A rising GDP could convey that the government’s policies have led to increased employment opportunities. And this could be a crucial factor for voters. Therefore, such claims could help establish a growing confidence and a sense of stability among the voters, a crucial aspect for any citizen to vote for a party. A strong GDP also attracts domestic and foreign investments, showing that the country is economically viable. Basically, the news of a strong GDP can influence public perception and confidence that the ruling government is effectively managing the country’s economy. Also read: The Hollowness of the Modi Government’s Tall Claims and Self-Praise on Economy The real growth figures Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has said that the Union government’s goal to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was “more aspirational than a carefully computed one”. Moreover, who will gain if India reaches the $5 trillion economy mark in 2024? Will a $5 trillion economy or a good income and job matter to ordinary Indians, belonging to the lower, lower-middle, and middle class? It is crucial to address the employment needs of the country’s youth. According to Rajan, India’s economy needs to grow by over 8% to meet the job demands of its vast population.  The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data, for July 2022 to June 2023, showed that a significant number of individuals in India are engaging in self-employment or unpaid labour. It also said that India’s unemployment rate has reached a six-year low, standing at 3.2%. 
 So, is unpaid labour boosting India’s employment figures? As many as 57.3% of the workers are now self-employed. This share was 52.2% six years ago. While India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it is also one of the most unequal countries, with rising poverty and an ‘affluent elite’. Premium car sales surge, but entry-level vehicles find fewer buyers; cookie demand grows, while biscuit sales slow; and India is turning into a magnet for luxury brands, but FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) sales are undergoing a slowdown – these are telltale signs of a K-shaped, or an uneven, economic recovery. Apart from economic issues such as high inflation and crony capitalism, mental health, majoritarian politics and press freedom also impact the overall growth of the economy. A Deloitte report estimated that Indian companies could suffer a loss of $14 billion a year due to poor mental health among employees. A psychiatrist had told TOI that many Indian psychiatrists are moving abroad for “greener pastures”. And that’s leading to a shortage of psychiatrists in this country. Note that India has 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 population. The desirable number is anything above three psychiatrists per 100,000 people. Economist Jayati Ghosh, in a paper titled Hindutva, Economic Neoliberalism and the Abuse of Economic Statistics in India, explained how the Narendra Modi government’s efforts at implementing the Hindutva agenda adversely affect economic activity. The Wire had reported in April 2021, that a year after the 2019 Delhi riots – which killed 53 people – Muslim families were selling homes and moving out of Northeast Delhi. They sold their houses at low prices – at least 25% below market rates. The PLFS report highlighted that among the major religious groups, only Muslims have experienced a decline in their labour force participation rate and worker population ratio. Separately, there is evidence to support that attacks on press freedom – such as jailing journalists, raiding their homes, shutting down printing presses, and using colonial laws to arrest reporters – have measurable effects on economic growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/diplomacy/india-resumes-e-visa-services-canadians,Diplomacy,"Two Months Later, India Resumes e-Visa Services for Canadians","New Delhi: India has resumed e-visa applications for Canadian nationals, two months after all visa services were stopped after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had accused India of involvement in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. While there is no announcement, official sources said that e-visa services have been resumed for Canadian nationals on Wednesday.  On September 21, India suspended visa services, citing alleged ‘security threats’ against diplomatic staff. Indian officials had said that it was not safe for Indian diplomats to process visas in missions in Canada, signalling that Ottawa’s response to its concerns was inadequate. India had also suspended e-visa services for Canadians despite the processing taking place in New Delhi. About a month later, the Indian high commission in Canada announced that it was partially resuming the services for entry, business, medical and conference visas after taking “into account some recent Canadian measures” following a security review. Earlier, Indian external affairs minister S. Jaishankar had said that New Delhi would resume visa operations if there was substantial “progress” in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats. This time, the e-visa services are being resumed, but not through a formal declaration. After Trudeau made the allegations in the House of Commons, both countries had expelled one diplomat each. India had dismissed the accusations as “biased and motivated”. Additionally, New Delhi sought “parity” and furnished a list of names to the Canadian side whose diplomatic immunity would be revoked if they did not leave by October 10, which was later extended by 10 days.  Canada announced that it had withdrawn 41 diplomats from India and stopped in-person facilities at three consulates in the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://thewire.in/world/rubble-us-rules-based-order-gaza,World,The Rubble of America’s ‘Rules-Based Order’ in Gaza,"The White House lit up with spooky colors and inflatable pumpkins for Halloween last month. President Joe Biden handed out chocolate boxes to costume-clad kids who lined up to meet him, and adorably feigned horror at some of their costumes. Among the kids were Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s son, who came dressed as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and daughter, who came dressed as Ukraine itself. Nobody came to Biden’s party dressed as Israel or Palestine, where, half a world away, the war was getting even more horrific, with Israel beginning to target the most densely populated areas of Gaza as part of its retaliation to the Hamas terror attacks that killed 1,400 Israelis on October 7. Israeli air strikes pounded Gaza’s largest refugee camp, flattening apartment buildings and triggering apocalyptic scenes. Children were seen carrying other injured children to safety amid hysterical screams, picking their way through the gray dust and the fresh rubble scattered with the dead and the dying. Six times as many children have been killed in Gaza in the three weeks of the conflict than the total number of children killed in the entire Ukraine war. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed so far in Gaza, which the UNICEF calls a “graveyard” for children, who account for more than 40% of the dead. The UN Children’s Fund estimates 420 children are killed or injured in Gaza every day, “a number which should shake each of us to our core.” An unshaken Biden, who has extended unconditional support and military assistance to Israel and has opposed a ceasefire, has feigned disbelief at the numbers. That puts him at odds with the outpouring of global condemnation at the impunity with which civilian lives are being erased in what the United Nations calls “collective punishment.” Israeli historian Raz Segal, who studies the Holocaust and modern genocide, calls it a “textbook case of genocide.” Even national leaders, many of them close US allies, are not mincing their words and are breaking ranks with the American policy of de facto carte blanche. As the war intensifies and the body bags pile up, US double standards on the victims of Ukraine and Gaza invasions become glaringly obvious, especially in the Global South that is often subject to American sermons on liberty and human rights. These days the only thing the leading custodian of the liberal international order seems to be liberal with is brown bodies. Broad condemnation Like Segal, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sees the military campaign as a genocide. Malaysian Prime Minister and democracy icon Anwar Ibrahim calls it the “height of barbarism.” Belgium wants sanctions on Israel for the “inhumane” air strikes. France wants Israel to stop bombing and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Israel needs to stop killing babies. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, another US ally, stresses that “every Palestinian life matters” and is urging Israel to observe the rules of war, which UN secretary general António Guterres accuses Israel of grossly violating. The high priests of the liberal order are invoking anti-Semitism to combat any critique of Israel. France is considering jail terms for “insults” to Israel, while the British government likens anti-war demonstrations to “hate marches.” But to many people outside the West and the Islamic world – with no natural solidarity with the Palestinians or baggage of guilt about the Holocaust that automatically treats criticism of the Israeli state as anti-Semitism – the human tragedy wreaked on Gaza is simply unacceptable. The heartbreaking images from the conflict evoke horror at the unrestrained mutilation of the norms of accepted state behaviour, and the helplessness of the global system of laws and institutions in stopping it. Gaza increasingly looks like the killing fields of the “rules-based order” that the Biden administration has made its mantra. If this carnage in Gaza is part of an “order” of any kind, pray what disorder looks like. This wouldn’t be the first time for the rules-based order to be profaned, of course. Israel is only pummeling what little credibility was left of it after the unilateral excesses of Iraq and Ukraine invasions. But the international backlash on Gaza reflects an unprecedented crisis of moral authority of the liberal order, in particular the US, which has spearheaded its making since the end of the Second World War and embedded its global leadership in its institutions. Gaza raises serious questions about America’s actions and judgment, and by extension the very legitimacy of the liberal order that it evangelizes. Questions like, what is the rationale of pulling out troops from Afghanistan to leave its people to their fate in the hands of the Taliban and then surging troops in the Middle East? Or, what is the rationale of opposing occupation in Ukraine and backing it in Gaza? Or, why is it that the only Muslims that America seems to care about are the ones who live in China? In a world horrified by the sights of Gaza, the optics of Biden flying to Israel and hugging its leader, America’s casual acceptance of the inevitability of mass-scale civilian deaths in Gaza, its blocking of even “humanitarian pauses” in the UN to get in lifesaving aid, and its assistance to Israel to carry on the war, call into question like never before the fairness and capability of the current rules-based multilateralism, as well as America’s credentials in leading it. UN failures The UN system is at the core of this liberal multilateral order, and its current state is a fair indicator as to why the liberal order is flailing. Presenting the plan to set up the United Nations, US president Franklin Roosevelt promised Congress in 1945 that it would “spell the end of the system of unilateral action, the exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the balances of power, and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries.” Let alone stopping the unilateral bombing in Gaza, the UN has failed even to protect its own staff from it. More than a hundred  of its members have been killed in Israeli bombardment of UN facilities, which are supposedly inviolable in conflict situations as a matter of rule. Vested with the authority to enforce peace, the UN has seldom looked this powerless. Its helpless pleas for peace on social media make it look every bit the sideshow that it has been reduced to – by the very power that swears by it. The grand promise of the “rules-based order” that Biden dangles to the Global South has thus never rung hollower. His administration uses it as a catch phrase to consolidate a global alliance against an ascendant China that it claims is out to wreck the liberal order. But China has in fact shown much greater respect for the “rules” in this conflict and has come across as a more responsible power by firmly opposing Israel’s retaliatory excesses and calling for a ceasefire, unlike America’s steadfast opposition to it despite the UN’s repeated appeals. America’s response to the crisis has undermined both its assertions of moral superiority over its new cold-war rival and the liberal order, which has already been under scrutiny. Quest for alternatives The new powers in an emerging multipolar world argue that it is too West-centric and lacks diversity and accountability. Global South groupings like BRICS are seen as budding platforms prepping for an alternative alignment of power with a different set of rules of engagement. Might Gaza hasten the process? Could the liberal order survive the single greatest instance of its delegitimization? These may be trying times for the liberal order, which is bad news at a time of a worldwide rise of right-wing authoritarians peddling toxic nationalism. But it may still not be the end of days for it. The Global South is hardly a homogenous entity. Sample the difference between India’s strong backing of Israel and the pro-Palestine stance of other BRICS founding members. Scholars of international order such as John Ikenberry have long argued that the American liberal hegemonic order may be in crisis, but not the liberal order itself as there is no grand alternative to it, and as American unipolarity fades and other powers emerge, there will appear new international leaders happy to engage with, and own, the liberal order. All emerging and middle powers such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, while wanting to imbue global governing institutions with what they consider their own national values and interests, have also engaged actively with the rules-based order, not rejected it. So the rules-based order won’t die from the wounds of Gaza even as its moral failure makes it more vulnerable than ever before to demands for change. But Gaza could well mark that moment of transition when it ceases to be the preserve of an America seen to be too partisan or too powerless to mediate the rules fairly. The moment of transition that marks America’s passing as the dominant global power in the eyes of the rest of the world. Whatever form it takes after it emerges from Gaza’s rubble, the liberal order will not be America’s to wield any more. Debasish Roy Chowdhury is a journalist based in Hong Kong.

r is polluted from sewage pushed upon us by the occupation through the Gaza Valley… How generous life can be giving you all those options to die… Whoever doesn’t die by shelling dies by hunger and thirst; or by the sickness from them; or by pollution of water, air, soil, and produce; or by the fire of a candle lit by a mother to ease fear of the dark in her children when the electricity is out, and the candle burning down the house and the children as they sleep; or by defeat and sorrow over helplessness in getting one’s kids some basic clothing they asked for; or by bitterness over an age slipping through your fingers and dreams buried while you stay in place, for your education doesn’t do you good, nor do your qualifications… and the list is long… If you see us on screens rising from under the rubble thankful to God, or mourning our beloved with folk songs, or receiving the news of truce with a short-lived sense of joy, it is not because we hate life; it is just that we are used to death… We die every day, in many ways, until we confused the definition of salvation; is it that you survive shelling and live, or die in martyrdom to be saved from such a life?

Story 19: November 15, 2023 The Smell of Gunpowder: There are two kinds of killing we are exposed to daily and always from this criminal usurper. The first is direct killing, using the strongest, most destructive types of missiles in the world. Those can annihilate and kill laaaaarge numbers of people, surpassing 100 per hit, typically of women, children, and the elderly. As for the second, it is a slow death for those who live day-by-day in this ugly war. This is primarily through destroying every civil resource like municipal services, which led to piling of garbage in neighbourhoods, especially with the large numbers of the internally displaced gathering in those neighbourhoods. This increases pollution on many levels, insect infestations, rats, foul smells, and air pollution. What is more difficult is that the usurper uses the direction of the wind as a weapon, especially at night. They shoot toxic smoke and internationally banned phosphorous bombs. The toxins move with the wind between neighbourhoods and into homes. Frequently, those toxins are accompanied by a strong, foul odour that smells much like gunpowder, and gives us a feeling of death by suffocation. I remember the early morning breeze as cool and refreshing, expanding your chest with joy. I used to long to smell the dew drops and begin my day on that note… especially on days I planned to play football (soccer). But this foul smell increases by sunrise, robbing us of the nature’s simple gift of clean air… My 75-year-old father cannot stand this suffocating smell, and coughs and sneezes for a long time. Our heart sinks of fear for his health each time this happens. Then he confesses: “I have lived through maaany wars in my life but have never witnessed anything like this war and this brutality. I cannot bear this.” So do children. They are deeply impacted for they cough even when sleeping, as if they have a heavy flu. My 7-year-old daughter always says: “Daddy, my nose is blocked and I can’t breathe. I wish I can have some good air!” Where do I get my daughter some good air… I hold her and stay silent. We started thinking about simple solutions for this problem, so we soaked pieces of cloth in water, which itself is scarce. When we smell those toxins, we cover our noses and try to breathe slowly until the smoke subsides. My wife looks at me, tearful from all the smoke and gunpowder, and wonders: “Is it our destiney to die by suffocation?” A lot of people say that if we make it alive, we will probably die by diseases resulting from these toxins. As if the occupiers have planned a never ending series of death to extract all hope of life, even after this war is over. We have God, for He is our agent.
